== Executive Summary

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: JWT validation analysis has revealed specific bottlenecks through comprehensive code analysis and JFR profiling:

* **Signature Verification**: 50-60% of processing time (cryptographic operations + JWKS key lookup)
* **JSON Parsing**: 15-20% of processing time (Jakarta JSON API with security limits)
* **JWKS Key Loading**: 10-15% of processing time (potential bug: keys should be preloaded, health checks should be bypassed when all keys loaded)
* **Token/Claims Processing**: 10-15% of processing time (claim extraction and validation)

**Performance Gap Root Cause**:

* Library standalone: 30,000 ops/s
* Integration performance: 260 ops/s (115x slower - FIRST PRIORITY: investigate missing Quarkus optimizations)
* Primary bottlenecks: Network I/O (40-50%) + Cryptographic operations (30-40%)

**Key Insight**: The optimization focus is on closing the 115x performance gap between library capability (30k ops/s) and integration performance (260 ops/s) through missing Quarkus optimizations and JWT validation pipeline improvements.

== Current Performance Status

=== ✅ BREAKTHROUGH: Enhanced Reflection Configuration SUCCESS

== CRITICAL OPTIMIZATION RULES

**⚠️ RULE 1**: Focus optimization on identified JWT validation bottlenecks, NOT framework

**⚠️ RULE 2**: Test individual changes with >5% improvement threshold

**⚠️ RULE 3**: Record ALL attempts in xref:performance-optimization-log.adoc[Performance Optimization Log]

**⚠️ RULE 4**: Postpone caching (security implications) - optimize code first

=== Mandatory Process

1. **Baseline Measurement**: Use `benchmark-with-monitoring.sh` for all tests
2. **Single Change**: Implement ONLY ONE optimization at a time
3. **JFR Analysis**: Profile callstack for every optimization attempt
4. **Verification**: Document before/after metrics with concrete numbers
5. **Documentation**: Update performance logs immediately

=== Resource Utilization Targets

* **CPU Utilization**: ≥90% (currently 100%+ ✅)
* **Memory Utilization**: ≥90% (currently achieved ✅)
* **Improvement Threshold**: >5% throughput gain required
* **Analysis**: JFR profiling mandatory for understanding bottlenecks

== FIRST PRIORITY: Quarkus Integration Optimization Gap ✅ COMPLETED

=== Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Enhanced Reflection Configuration Applied

**Objective**: Close the 115x performance gap between cui-jwt-validation library (30k ops/s) and Quarkus integration (260 ops/s).

**Completed Investigation Results**:

* 86% of framework NOOP performance (280,000 ops/s)

== Priority 2: Signature Algorithm Performance Optimization 🔥

=== Status: Ready to Execute

**Objective**: Optimize signature verification performance for ALL JOSE-compliant algorithms. Since JWT signature algorithms are defined by JOSE Requirements, we must improve performance across all supported algorithms rather than favoring specific ones.

**Critical Constraint**: All JOSE algorithms must maintain equivalent performance - no algorithm selection bias allowed.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] **1.1** Benchmark ALL signature algorithms for optimization opportunities
+
Test optimization techniques across ALL JOSE algorithms:
+
* **ECDSA (ES256/384/512)**: JOSE required - optimize JDK crypto provider usage
* **RSA (RS256/384/512)**: JOSE required - optimize RSA verification efficiency  
* **RSA-PSS (PS256/384/512)**: JOSE required - optimize PSS parameter handling
+
**Note**: Must ensure Quarkus native compatibility for ALL algorithm optimizations.

- [ ] **1.2** Profile crypto provider performance optimizations
+
Optimize underlying cryptographic operations:
+
* JDK crypto provider configuration for native image
* Memory allocation patterns in signature verification
* Key material access patterns and caching

- [ ] **1.3** Implement signature verification result caching (if beneficial)
+
Cache verified tokens maintaining security:
+
* Target: Eliminate repeated crypto verification for identical tokens
* Security: Maintain token security while optimizing repeated verifications
* **Quarkus Native**: Ensure caching works correctly in native image

**Implementation Rule**: ALL optimizations must work for ALL JOSE algorithms in Quarkus native context.

== Priority 3: JSON Parser Performance Optimization 🔥

=== Status: Ready to Execute

**Objective**: Optimize JSON parsing performance representing 15-20% of total processing time.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] **2.1** Compare JSON parser alternatives (Quarkus Native Compatible Only)
+
Test JWT payload parsing performance with libraries optimized for Quarkus native:
+
* **Jakarta JSON API** (current): Security-first design, native image compatible
* **Jackson ObjectMapper**: IF properly configured for Quarkus native (reflection-free mode)
* **Quarkus Jackson**: Built-in Quarkus Jackson extension with native optimizations
+
**MANDATORY**: Each library must be verified working and optimized for Quarkus native image before testing.

- [ ] **2.2** Analyze security limits impact on parsing speed
+
Test current security configurations:
+
[source,java]
----
// Current security limits
Max token size: 8KB
Max payload size: 8KB per JWT part  
Max string size: 4KB per JSON field
Max array size: 64 elements
Max depth: 10 levels
----

- [X] **2.3** ~~Base64 decoding overhead~~ (RESEARCH COMPLETED - NOT A BOTTLENECK)
+
**Research Conclusion**: Base64 decoding is NOT a performance bottleneck in modern Java JWT processing:
+
* Current `java.util.Base64.getUrlDecoder()` implementation is optimal
* Base64 operations take microseconds vs milliseconds for cryptographic operations
* Represents <1% of JWT validation processing time
* **Recommendation**: Focus optimization efforts on cryptographic operations and JWKS caching instead

**Implementation Rule**: ALL JSON parser alternatives must work correctly in Quarkus native image context.

== Priority 4: JWKS Caching Optimization 🔥

=== Status: Ready to Execute

**Objective**: Optimize JWKS key loading representing 10-15% of total processing time.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] **4.1** Profile JWKS cache hit/miss patterns under load
+
Analyze cache effectiveness during benchmark runs:
+
* Measure cache hit rate for production workloads
* Measure HTTP call frequency for JWKS endpoints
* Profile issuer config resolution patterns

- [ ] **4.2** Optimize issuer config health check patterns (POTENTIAL BUG)
+
**CRITICAL**: Implement optimized path when all keys are loaded - eliminate health checks completely:
+
[source,java]
----
// OPTIMIZED: Skip health checks when keys preloaded
for (IssuerConfig config : issuerConfigs) {
    if (config.matchesIssuer(issuer)) {
        // If all keys loaded, skip health check
        if (config.areAllKeysLoaded()) {
            return config;
        }
        // Only check health if keys need loading
        if (config.isHealthy()) {
            return config;
        }
    }
}
----
+
**Investigation Required**: Current implementation may contain bug - JWKS keys should be preloaded and health checks bypassed when all keys available.

- [ ] **4.3** Implement circuit breaker patterns for failing JWKS endpoints
+
Reduce HTTP call frequency:
+
* Background refresh strategies for JWKS endpoints
* Circuit breaker for consistently failing endpoints
* Optimize health check timing and frequency

**Implementation Rule**: ALL JWKS optimizations must maintain security compliance and work correctly in Quarkus native image context.

== Implementation Strategy

=== Implementation Order (Critical Priority Sequence)

**FIRST**: Quarkus Integration Gap Analysis - MUST be completed before other optimizations

**SECOND**: Signature Algorithm Optimization - All JOSE algorithms must maintain equivalent performance

**THIRD**: JSON Parser Replacement - Only Quarkus native compatible alternatives

**FOURTH**: JWKS Caching Enhancement - Focus on health check bypass when keys preloaded

=== Build Requirements
