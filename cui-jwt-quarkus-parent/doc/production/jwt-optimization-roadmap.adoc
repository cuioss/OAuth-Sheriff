== Executive Summary

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: JWT validation represents a **1000x performance bottleneck** compared to framework overhead:
- **JWT Validation**: 260 ops/s (3.75ms per request)
- **Framework Baseline (NOOP)**: 280,000 ops/s (0.35ms per request)
- **JWT Processing Cost**: 91% of total request time (3.4ms out of 3.75ms)

**Key Insight**: The bottleneck is **NOT** the REST framework, HTTP handling, or programming model - it's the cryptographic JWT validation itself. This dramatically shifts optimization priorities.

=== Critical Performance Insights

1. **Framework is Excellent** (280k ops/s) - no optimization needed
2. **JWT Validation Dominates** (91% of request time) - primary optimization target
3. **Programming Model Irrelevant** (<2% difference vs 1000x JWT cost)
4. **Library Integration Issue** (30k ops/s capability vs 260 ops/s actual)

== CRITICAL OPTIMIZATION RULES

**⚠️ RULE 1**: Focus optimization on JWT validation logic, NOT framework
**⚠️ RULE 2**: Test individual changes with >5% improvement threshold
**⚠️ RULE 3**: Record ALL attempts in performance-optimization-log.adoc
**⚠️ RULE 4**: Postpone caching (security implications) - optimize code first

=== Mandatory Process

1. **Baseline Measurement**: Use benchmark-with-monitoring.sh for all tests
2. **Single Change**: Implement ONLY ONE optimization at a time
3. **JFR Analysis**: Profile callstack for every optimization attempt
4. **Verification**: Document before/after metrics with concrete numbers
5. **Documentation**: Update performance logs immediately

=== Resource Utilization Targets

- **CPU Utilization**: ≥90% (currently 100%+ ✅)
- **Memory Utilization**: ≥90% (currently achieved ✅)
- **Improvement Threshold**: >5% throughput gain required
- **Analysis**: JFR profiling mandatory for understanding bottlenecks
