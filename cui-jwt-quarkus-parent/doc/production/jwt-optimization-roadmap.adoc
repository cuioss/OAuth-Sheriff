== Executive Summary

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: JWT validation analysis has revealed specific bottlenecks through comprehensive code analysis and JFR profiling:

* **Signature Verification**: 50-60% of processing time (cryptographic operations + JWKS key lookup)
* **JSON Parsing**: 15-20% of processing time (Jakarta JSON API with security limits)
* **JWKS Key Loading**: 10-15% of processing time (HTTP calls and health checks)
* **Token/Claims Processing**: 10-15% of processing time (claim extraction and validation)

**Performance Gap Root Cause**:

* Library standalone: 30,000 ops/s
* Integration performance: 260 ops/s (115x slower)
* Primary bottlenecks: Network I/O (40-50%) + Cryptographic operations (30-40%)

**Key Insight**: The optimization focus has shifted from framework overhead to specific JWT validation pipeline bottlenecks identified through detailed method-level analysis.

**NOOP Implementation**: Removed after establishing framework baseline performance (280k ops/s).

== CRITICAL OPTIMIZATION RULES

**⚠️ RULE 1**: Focus optimization on identified JWT validation bottlenecks, NOT framework

**⚠️ RULE 2**: Test individual changes with >5% improvement threshold

**⚠️ RULE 3**: Record ALL attempts in xref:performance-optimization-log.adoc[Performance Optimization Log]

**⚠️ RULE 4**: Postpone caching (security implications) - optimize code first

=== Mandatory Process

1. **Baseline Measurement**: Use `benchmark-with-monitoring.sh` for all tests
2. **Single Change**: Implement ONLY ONE optimization at a time
3. **JFR Analysis**: Profile callstack for every optimization attempt
4. **Verification**: Document before/after metrics with concrete numbers
5. **Documentation**: Update performance logs immediately

=== Resource Utilization Targets

* **CPU Utilization**: ≥90% (currently 100%+ ✅)
* **Memory Utilization**: ≥90% (currently achieved ✅)
* **Improvement Threshold**: >5% throughput gain required
* **Analysis**: JFR profiling mandatory for understanding bottlenecks

== Priority 1: Signature Algorithm Performance Testing 🔥

=== Status: Ready to Execute

**Objective**: Test signature algorithm performance characteristics based on JFR analysis showing 50-60% of processing time spent in signature verification.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] **1.1** Benchmark signature algorithms comparative performance
+
Configure test issuers with different signature algorithms:
+
* **ECDSA (ES256/384/512)**: Expected fastest verification performance
* **RSA (RS256/384/512)**: Most common, moderate performance  
* **RSA-PSS (PS256/384/512)**: Expected slowest due to PSS parameters

- [ ] **1.2** Measure algorithm-specific JFR performance
+
Profile signature verification methods specifically:
+
* `TokenSignatureValidator.validateSignature()`
* JDK crypto provider performance for each algorithm
* JWKS key lookup patterns and cache effectiveness

- [ ] **1.3** Implement signature verification result caching (if beneficial)
+
Cache verified tokens for short TTL (30-60 seconds):
+
* Target: Eliminate repeated crypto verification for identical tokens
* Expected Impact: 50-60% improvement for cached tokens
* Security: Maintain token security while optimizing repeated verifications

**Expected Impact**: 20-40% improvement from optimal algorithm choice

**Risk**: Low (configuration changes only)

== Priority 2: JSON Parser Performance Optimization 🔥

=== Status: Ready to Execute

**Objective**: Optimize JSON parsing performance representing 15-20% of total processing time.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] **2.1** Compare JSON parser alternatives
+
Test JWT payload parsing performance (typically 1-4KB):
+
* **Jakarta JSON API** (current): Security-first design with limits
* **Jackson ObjectMapper**: Industry standard with performance focus
* **jsoniter**: High-performance JSON library
* **fast-json**: Alternative high-performance option

- [ ] **2.2** Analyze security limits impact on parsing speed
+
Test current security configurations:
+
[source,java]
----
// Current security limits
Max token size: 8KB
Max payload size: 8KB per JWT part  
Max string size: 4KB per JSON field
Max array size: 64 elements
Max depth: 10 levels
----

- [ ] **2.3** Measure Base64 decoding overhead separately
+
Profile Base64 URL decoding for all 3 JWT parts:
+
* Isolate Base64 decoding from JSON parsing performance
* Test impact of JWT part size on decoding performance
* Optimize security vs performance balance

**Expected Impact**: 15-20% improvement from faster JSON processing

**Risk**: Medium (library changes with security validation required)

== Priority 3: JWKS Caching Optimization 🔥

=== Status: Ready to Execute

**Objective**: Optimize JWKS key loading representing 10-15% of total processing time.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] **3.1** Profile JWKS cache hit/miss patterns under load
+
Analyze cache effectiveness during benchmark runs:
+
* Target >95% cache hit rate for production workloads
* Measure HTTP call frequency for JWKS endpoints
* Profile issuer config resolution patterns

- [ ] **3.2** Optimize issuer config health check patterns
+
Reduce network I/O overhead:
+
[source,java]
----
// Current health check iteration
for (IssuerConfig config : issuerConfigs) {
    if (config.isHealthy() && config.matchesIssuer(issuer)) {
        return config;
    }
}
----

- [ ] **3.3** Implement circuit breaker patterns for failing JWKS endpoints
+
Reduce HTTP call frequency:
+
* Background refresh strategies for JWKS endpoints
* Circuit breaker for consistently failing endpoints
* Optimize health check timing and frequency

**Expected Impact**: 10-15% improvement from reduced network I/O

**Risk**: Medium (configuration and caching logic changes)
