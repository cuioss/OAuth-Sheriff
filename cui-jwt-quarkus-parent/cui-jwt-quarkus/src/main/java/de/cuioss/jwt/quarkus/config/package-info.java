/**
 * <h2>Configuration for CUI JWT Quarkus Extension</h2>
 * <p>
 * This package contains the configuration classes for the CUI JWT Quarkus extension.
 * Configuration is accessed directly through MicroProfile Config to ensure compatibility
 * with native images and avoid ConfigMapping fragility issues.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The configuration supports the multi-issuer approach of the library,
 * allowing different validation settings for different token issuers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All properties are prefixed with "cui.jwt".
 * </p>
 * 
 * @since 1.0
