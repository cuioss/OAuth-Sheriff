== Overview
[x] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Ensure the extension works properly in native mode:

. Add native image configuration:
+
--
* Create reflection configuration for classes that need reflection
* Configure resources that need to be included in the native image
* Add proxy configuration for dynamic proxies
--
. Test native image compatibility:
+
--
* Create native tests with @NativeImageTest
* Verify all functionality works in native mode
* Measure and optimize native startup time
--
. Optimize for native performance:
+
--
* Minimize reflection usage where possible
* Use build-time initialization where appropriate
* Ensure proper resource cleanup
--

*Rationale:* Native image support is a key feature of Quarkus, and extensions should work seamlessly in both JVM and native modes. This requires special configuration and testing to ensure all functionality works correctly when compiled to a native executable.

== Implementation Steps

* [x] Create native image configuration files
* [x] Add reflection configuration for necessary classes
* [x] Configure resource inclusion
* [x] Add proxy configuration if needed
* [x] Create native tests
* [x] Optimize for native performance
* [x] Document native image considerations

== Task Completion Checklist

--
* [x] Verify all implementation steps are completed
* [x] Check code against Quarkus and CUI standards
* [x] Ensure proper error handling and edge cases are covered
* [x] Verify compatibility with both JVM and native mode
--

*2. Write Tests:*
+
--
* [x] Write unit tests for all components
* [x] Create integration tests for real-world scenarios
* [x] Test with different configuration options
* [x] Verify error cases and edge conditions
--

*3. Verify Documentation:*
+
--
* [x] Update all references in README.adoc
* [x] Update relevant documentation in doc/ directory
* [x] Check for outdated file paths or references
