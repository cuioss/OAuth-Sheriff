== Overview
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Create CDI producers for the core JWT validation components:

. Create a producer class that provides:
+
--
* `TokenValidator` bean with proper configuration
* Support for multiple issuer configurations
--
. Ensure proper injection of configuration properties from JwtValidationConfig
. Implement appropriate qualifiers if multiple TokenValidator instances are needed
. Configure beans as application-scoped where appropriate
. Add startup validation to fail fast if configuration is invalid

*Rationale:* CDI producers allow Quarkus applications to easily inject and use the JWT validation components without manual instantiation. This improves developer experience and ensures proper configuration and lifecycle management of the components.

== Implementation Steps

* [ ] Create TokenValidatorProducer class
* [ ] Implement producer method for TokenValidator that uses the injected JwtValidationConfig
* [ ] Create IssuerConfigFactory to convert configuration properties to IssuerConfig objects
* [ ] Add appropriate scopes (@ApplicationScoped) and qualifiers if needed
* [ ] Implement startup validation in the producer (@PostConstruct)
* [ ] Create unit tests for producers with various configuration scenarios
* [ ] Document available beans in README with injection examples

== Task Completion Checklist

*1. Verify Implementation:*
+
--
* [ ] Verify all implementation steps are completed
* [ ] Check code against Quarkus and CUI standards
* [ ] Ensure proper error handling and edge cases are covered
* [ ] Verify compatibility with both JVM and native mode
--

*2. Write Tests:*
+
--
* [ ] Write unit tests for all components
* [ ] Create integration tests for real-world scenarios
* [ ] Test with different configuration options
* [ ] Verify error cases and edge conditions
--

*3. Verify Documentation:*
+
--
* [ ] Update all references in README.adoc
* [ ] Update relevant documentation in doc/ directory
* [ ] Check for outdated file paths or references
* [ ] Ensure consistent naming across all documentation
* [ ] Add examples for common use cases
--

*4. Update Status:*
+
--
* [ ] Mark the task as completed with [x]
* [ ] Add any notes about implementation challenges or decisions if needed
--

*5. Make a Full Build:*
+
--
* [ ] Run the the module build: `.cd cui-jwt-quarkus-parent && mvn clean install` (from project-root)
** [ ] Verify all tests pass
** [ ] Check for any warnings that should be addressed
** [ ] Verify code coverage meets standards
* [ ] Run the full build command: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify` (from project-root)
** [ ] Verify all tests pass
** [ ] Check for any warnings that should be addressed
