== Overview
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Create Quarkus health checks for JWT validation components:

. Implement a health check for JWKS endpoint connectivity using Quarkus SmallRye Health
+
--
* Check connectivity to each configured JWKS endpoint
* Report detailed status information for each issuer
--
. Add a health check for token validation capabilities
+
--
* Verify that TokenValidator is properly configured
* Test with a simple validation operation
--
. Include relevant details in health check responses:
+
--
* Issuer URL
* Last successful refresh time
* Number of cached keys
* Connection status
--
. Configure appropriate health check groups:
+
--
* Readiness check for JWKS endpoint connectivity
* Liveness check for TokenValidator functionality
--
. Ensure health checks don't impact performance:
+
--
* Use caching to prevent excessive network calls
* Implement circuit breaker pattern for failing endpoints
--

*Rationale:* Health checks provide visibility into the operational status of JWT validation components, which is crucial for containerized environments and Kubernetes deployments.

== Implementation Steps

* [ ] Create JwksEndpointHealthCheck class implementing HealthCheck
* [ ] Create TokenValidatorHealthCheck class implementing HealthCheck
* [ ] Implement health check logic with proper error handling
* [ ] Configure appropriate scopes (@ApplicationScoped) and groups (@Readiness, @Liveness)
* [ ] Implement caching mechanism to prevent performance impact
* [ ] Add unit tests for health checks with mock responses
* [ ] Create integration test with actual health check endpoints
* [ ] Document health check endpoints and response format with examples

== Task Completion Checklist

*1. Verify Implementation:*
+
--
* [ ] Verify all implementation steps are completed
* [ ] Check code against Quarkus and CUI standards
* [ ] Ensure proper error handling and edge cases are covered
* [ ] Verify compatibility with both JVM and native mode
--

*2. Write Tests:*
+
--
* [ ] Write unit tests for all components
* [ ] Create integration tests for real-world scenarios
* [ ] Test with different configuration options
* [ ] Verify error cases and edge conditions
--

*3. Verify Documentation:*
+
--
* [ ] Update all references in README.adoc
* [ ] Update relevant documentation in doc/ directory
* [ ] Check for outdated file paths or references
* [ ] Ensure consistent naming across all documentation
* [ ] Add examples for common use cases
--

*4. Update Status:*
+
--
* [ ] Mark the task as completed with [x]
* [ ] Add any notes about implementation challenges or decisions if needed
--

*5. Make a Full Build:*
+
--
* [ ] Run the full build command: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify -pl cui-jwt-quarkus-parent` (from project-root)
* [ ] Verify all tests pass
* [ ] Check for any warnings that should be addressed
* [ ] Verify code coverage meets standards
--

*6. Commit Changes:*
+
--
* [ ] Stage all modified files
* [ ] Use the task name as the commit message
* [ ] Include any additional notes about implementation decisions in the commit description
