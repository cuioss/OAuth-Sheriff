== Overview
[x] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Resolve testing infrastructure issues for the Quarkus extension:

. Fix logging initialization issues for tests:
+
--
* Research appropriate Maven setup for proper test logging
* Configure logging properly to eliminate warnings during test execution
* Ensure consistent logging behavior across test types
* Integrate with Quarkus test logging framework
--
. Enable and properly configure QuarkusUnitTest (CuiJwtExtensionTest):
+
--
* Research proper Maven configuration for Quarkus tests
* Configure test resources correctly
* Ensure proper dependency injection in test context
* Enable testing with both JVM and native modes
--
. Analyze test framework selection strategy:
+
--
* Research when to use QuarkusUnitTest vs WeldJunit
* Document decision criteria for test framework selection
* Create guidelines for which framework to use for different test scenarios
* Compare startup times, capabilities, and limitations of each approach
--

*Rationale:* A stable and properly configured test environment is essential for maintaining the quality of the extension. Fixing logging issues and enabling proper Quarkus tests will make development more efficient and prevent regressions.

== Implementation Steps

* [x] Research logging configurations for Quarkus tests
* [x] Configure logback-test.xml or other appropriate logging configuration
* [x] Research QuarkusUnitTest setup requirements
* [x] Configure test resources for proper Quarkus test context initialization
* [x] Update pom.xml with necessary test dependencies
* [x] Configure surefire plugin for proper test execution
* [x] Compare QuarkusUnitTest and WeldJunit performance and capabilities
* [x] Create decision matrix for test framework selection
* [x] Document guidelines for when to use each testing approach
* [x] Create example tests using both frameworks for comparison
* [x] Test the configuration with different test scenarios
* [x] Document the test setup for future reference
