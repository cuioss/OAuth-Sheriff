After implementing any task, follow these steps:

. *Verify Implementation*: Ensure the implementation meets all requirements and follows best practices.
+
--
* [ ] Verify all implementation steps are completed
* [ ] Check code against Quarkus and CUI standards
* [ ] Ensure proper error handling and edge cases are covered
* [ ] Verify compatibility with both JVM and native mode
--

. *Write Tests*: Create comprehensive tests for the implementation.
+
--
* [ ] Write unit tests for all components
* [ ] Create integration tests for real-world scenarios
* [ ] Test with different configuration options
* [ ] Verify error cases and edge conditions
--

. *Verify Documentation*: Ensure the documentation is updated correctly. Especially verify all the links/names are correct and consistent with the implementation.
+
--
* [ ] Update all references in README.adoc
* [ ] Update relevant documentation in doc/ directory
* [ ] Check for outdated file paths or references
* [ ] Ensure consistent naming across all documentation
* [ ] Add examples for common use cases
--

. *Update Status*: Check the checkbox for the completed task in the task file.
+
--
* [ ] Mark the task as completed with [x]
* [ ] Add any notes about implementation challenges or decisions if needed
--

. *Make a Full Build*:
+
--
* [ ] Run the the module build: `.cd cui-jwt-quarkus-parent && mvn clean install` (from project-root)
** [ ] Verify all tests pass
** [ ] Check for any warnings that should be addressed
** [ ] Verify code coverage meets standards
* [ ] Run the full build command: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify` (from project-root)
** [ ] Verify all tests pass
** [ ] Check for any warnings that should be addressed

--

. *Commit Changes (git-commit)*: Commit the changes with a git commit. Use the task name (e.g., "Task 1. Implement JWT Configuration") as the commit message.
+
--
* [ ] Stage all modified files
* [ ] Use the task name as the commit message
* [ ] Include any additional notes about implementation decisions in the commit description
