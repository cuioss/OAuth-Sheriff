This document outlines the planned tasks for the cui-jwt-quarkus module, which provides Quarkus integration for the cui-jwt-validation library. The module will enable Quarkus applications to easily configure and use JWT validation with proper CDI integration, metrics, and health checks.

== Task Structure

=== Task Numbering

Tasks are numbered sequentially (e.g., Task 1, Task 2, Task 3) for easy reference and tracking.

=== Task Format

Each task follows a consistent format:

[source]
----
=== Task [Number]. [Task Title]
[ ] *Priority:* [High/Medium/Low]

*Description:* [Detailed description of the task]

*Rationale:* [Explanation of why this task is important]

*Implementation Steps:* [Specific steps to complete the task]
----

== Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked using checkboxes in the task list:

* `[ ]` - Task not started or in progress
* `[x]` - Task completed

This simple visual indicator allows for quick assessment of project status. The checkboxes are updated manually after completing a task according to the Task Completion Process.

=== Current Progress

Progress can be assessed by:

. Counting completed tasks within each category
. Calculating the overall completion percentage
. Focusing on high-priority tasks first

=== Dependencies

The tasks have the following dependencies:

. Task 1 (Configuration) should be completed first as other tasks depend on it
. Task 2 (CDI Producers) depends on Task 1
. Tasks 3 (Metrics) and 4 (Health Checks) can be implemented in parallel after Task 2
. Task 5 (Documentation) should be updated throughout but finalized last

== Task Completion Process

See link:task-completion-process.adoc[Task Completion Process] for details on how to complete each task.

== Best Practices

=== Task Implementation

* Focus on one task at a time
* Complete the entire Task Completion Process before moving to the next task
* Prioritize tasks based on their priority level (High, Medium, Low)
* Document any unexpected challenges or decisions made during implementation
* Follow Quarkus extension development best practices:
+
--
* Use appropriate annotations for CDI components
* Follow Quarkus configuration naming conventions
* Ensure proper startup and shutdown behavior
* Minimize dependencies and startup time
--
* Ensure compatibility with both JVM and native mode

=== Documentation Updates

* Keep the TODO files up to date
* Document any changes to the implementation process
* Ensure all team members understand the process
* Follow CUI documentation standards as outlined in JUNIE.md

=== Testing Guidelines

* Write comprehensive unit tests for all components
* Create integration tests that verify the extension works in a real Quarkus application
* Test with different configuration scenarios (single issuer, multiple issuers)
* Test both JVM and native mode compilation
* Verify metrics and health checks work as expected
* Test with different token types (access, id, refresh)

== Conclusion

This structured approach ensures that the Quarkus integration is implemented systematically, with clear tracking of progress and consistent quality standards. The task list provides a roadmap for developing a robust, well-documented Quarkus extension for JWT validation that follows both Quarkus and CUI standards.

The implementation should focus on providing a seamless developer experience while maintaining the security and flexibility of the underlying JWT validation library. By following these guidelines, the extension will be maintainable, performant, and easy to use.

=== Next Steps

After completing the tasks in this document, consider the following next steps:

. Register the extension in the Quarkus extension registry
. Develop additional examples and tutorials for common use cases
