This document is governed by the general process rules defined in the project's refactoring standards.

This document describes the requirements and tasks for enhancing the JWT validation system with improved resilience patterns and configuration management.
====

== Overview

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the CUI JWT validation system to address current limitations in resilience patterns, configuration management, and service availability handling. The enhancements focus on making the system more robust in production environments where external services may be temporarily unavailable.

== Current System Analysis

=== Issues Identified

1. **WellKnownHandler Eager Loading**: The `WellKnownHandler` currently accesses the well-known URL during construction time, which can cause failures if the service is temporarily unavailable during application startup.

2. **Lack of Resilience Patterns**: Both `WellKnownHandler` and `HttpJwksLoader` do not implement comprehensive resilience patterns such as circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, or exponential backoff.

3. **Configuration Fragmentation**: The `enabled` logic from `JwtValidationConfig.IssuerConfig` is not natively supported by the core `IssuerConfig` interface, creating a disconnect between Quarkus configuration and the core validation implementation.

4. **Health Status Visibility**: There is no standard way to determine if an `IssuerConfig` or its underlying `JwksLoader` is healthy and can access cryptographic keys. Both levels need health status methods with proper delegation.

== Task Structure

=== Categories and Numbering

Tasks are organized into categories, each with its own prefix for task numbering:

* *R* - Resilience Enhancement tasks (e.g., R1, R2, R3)
* *C* - Configuration Management tasks (e.g., C1, C2)
* *H* - Health and Monitoring tasks (e.g., H1, H2)
* *I* - Integration and Compatibility tasks (e.g., I1, I2)

== Resilience Enhancement Tasks

=== R1. Research Resilience4j Integration
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Conduct comprehensive research on integrating Resilience4j for resilience patterns in the HTTP layer. Evaluate the minimal dependency footprint and compatibility with the existing `de.cuioss.tools.net.http.HttpHandler` architecture.

*Rationale:* Resilience4j is a mature, lightweight library that provides circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and bulkhead patterns. A minimal integration would enhance system stability without introducing significant complexity.

*Research Areas:*

- Dependency analysis (including transitive dependencies)
- Performance impact assessment
- Integration patterns with existing HttpHandler
- Configuration options and customization
- Native image compatibility (GraalVM/Quarkus)

=== R2. Implement Resilient HttpHandler Composition
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Create a resilient composition wrapper for `de.cuioss.tools.net.http.HttpHandler` that implements circuit breaker, retry, and exponential backoff patterns. The implementation should be lightweight and configurable.

*Rationale:* By composing resilience patterns around the existing HttpHandler, we can maintain compatibility while adding robustness. This approach follows the decorator pattern and preserves the existing API contract.

*Implementation Requirements:*

- Circuit breaker with configurable failure threshold and timeout
- Exponential backoff retry mechanism with jitter
- Bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
- Metrics collection for monitoring
- Fallback strategy support
- Thread-safe implementation

=== R3. Lazy Loading for WellKnownHandler
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Refactor `WellKnownHandler` to implement lazy loading of well-known endpoints. The handler should defer HTTP requests until the first actual access to endpoint data, allowing applications to start even when identity providers are temporarily unavailable.

*Rationale:* Lazy loading improves application startup resilience and reduces the impact of temporary service unavailability. This change aligns with cloud-native principles where services should be fault-tolerant during startup.

*Implementation Requirements:*

- Lazy initialization of endpoint discovery
- Thread-safe lazy loading implementation
- Proper exception handling for deferred operations
- Caching of successfully loaded endpoints
- Retry logic for failed initial loads
- **Architectural Change**: `build()` method should only validate configuration, not access well-known URLs
- Actual HTTP requests to well-known endpoints deferred until first actual access
- Integration with health check pattern: first `isHealthy()` call triggers discovery if needed

== Configuration Management Tasks

=== C1. Native Enabled Flag Support in IssuerConfig
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Extend the `IssuerConfig` interface to natively support the `enabled` flag that exists in `JwtValidationConfig.IssuerConfig`. The enabled flag should be properly integrated at the IssuerConfig level and control the behavior of the underlying `JwksLoader`.

*Rationale:* The `JwtValidationConfig.IssuerConfig` provides an `enabled` flag for configuration, but the core `IssuerConfig` interface doesn't natively support this concept. This creates a disconnect between Quarkus configuration intent and the core validation implementation.

*Implementation Requirements:*

- Add `boolean isEnabled()` method to `IssuerConfig` interface
- The enabled flag should be a pure configuration property
- When `!enabled`, the IssuerConfig should not attempt to use the underlying `JwksLoader`
- Proper integration with `TokenValidator` to respect the enabled flag
- Thread-safe implementation for concurrent access
- Clear documentation of enabled vs disabled behavior

=== C2. Health Status Support in IssuerConfig with JwksLoader Delegation
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Add health status support to `IssuerConfig` that delegates to the underlying `JwksLoader.isHealthy()` method. The IssuerConfig should provide a unified view of both configuration state (enabled) and runtime state (healthy).

*Rationale:* The IssuerConfig is the primary interface used by TokenValidator and should provide both configuration and health information. By delegating to JwksLoader for health status, it maintains proper separation of concerns while providing a unified interface.

*Implementation Requirements:*

- Add `boolean isHealthy()` method to `IssuerConfig` interface
- `IssuerConfig.isHealthy()` should delegate to the underlying `JwksLoader.isHealthy()`
- When `!enabled`, `IssuerConfig.isHealthy()` should always return `false`
- Proper null-safety and error handling in delegation
- Thread-safe implementation for concurrent access
- Clear documentation of the delegation pattern

== Health and Monitoring Tasks

=== H1. Health Check Implementation for JwksLoader
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Implement a `boolean isHealthy()` method in the `JwksLoader` interface to support health status delegation from `IssuerConfig`. The method should return `true` if the loader can access at least one cryptographic key, and `false` otherwise.

*Rationale:* The `JwksLoader` needs to provide the actual health status implementation that `IssuerConfig.isHealthy()` will delegate to. This allows for proper separation of concerns where JwksLoader focuses on key accessibility while IssuerConfig handles the overall configuration and health coordination.

*Implementation Requirements:*

- Add `boolean isHealthy()` method to `JwksLoader` interface
- Implementation across all loader types (HTTP, file, in-memory)
- Health check should verify actual key accessibility, not just configuration validity
- Thread-safe implementation
- No enabled flag dependency at this level (handled by `IssuerConfig`)
- Optional: Health check caching to avoid excessive validation calls
- Clear documentation of what constitutes "healthy" for each loader type
- **CRITICAL: Lazy Loading Architecture Change**:
  - All JWKS loaders must be refactored to defer loading/verification until `isHealthy()` is called
  - Current behavior of loading/verifying during `build()` must be changed to lazy initialization
  - `build()` should only validate configuration and prepare the loader, not access external resources
  - First call to `isHealthy()` triggers actual JWKS loading and key verification
  - Subsequent calls use cached keys which persist until replaced by newer versions (no re-verification needed)

=== H2. Health Check Optimization in TokenValidator
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Implement optimized on-demand health checking in `TokenValidator` that leverages the dual-map architecture. Health checks are performed only when resolving a requested issuer, with no periodic background checks.

*Rationale:* The dual-map approach provides optimal performance by avoiding repeated health checks for known-healthy issuers while maintaining the ability to detect recovered issuers on-demand. This eliminates the complexity of periodic background checks while ensuring the system can recover from transient failures.

*Implementation Requirements:*

- **Dual-Map Resolution Logic**:
  - If requested issuer is in `healthyIssuers` map: Use it directly, no health check needed
  - If requested issuer is in `unhealthyIssuers` map: Call `isHealthy()` to check current state on-demand
- **On-Demand Health Check Implementation**:
  - The `isHealthy()` method must perform all necessary checks to determine actual state
  - Implementation must be fail-fast to avoid blocking the entire TokenValidator
  - If health check succeeds, move issuer from `unhealthyIssuers` to `healthyIssuers` map
- **No Periodic Checks**: 
  - All health checks are triggered on-demand when resolving a specific issuer
  - No background threads or scheduled tasks for health checking
  - Simplifies implementation and reduces system complexity
- **Fail-Fast Architecture**:
  - Health checks must have short timeouts to prevent blocking
  - Failed health checks should not cascade to other issuers
  - Clear timeout configuration for health check operations
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of on-demand health check strategy

== Integration and Compatibility Tasks

=== I1. TokenValidator Dual-Map Architecture for Health Management
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Rework `TokenValidator` to implement a dual-map architecture that maintains separate maps for healthy and unhealthy `IssuerConfig` instances. The validator should filter out disabled issuers at construction time and dynamically manage the health status of enabled issuers.

*Rationale:* The current TokenValidator assumes all configured issuers are immediately available and functional. The dual-map approach provides efficient runtime performance by avoiding repeated health checks for known-healthy issuers while maintaining the ability to promote previously unhealthy issuers when they recover.

*Implementation Requirements:*

- **Constructor Filtering**: Only incorporate `IssuerConfig` instances where `isEnabled() == true`
- **Dual-Map Architecture**:
  - `healthyIssuers` map: Contains issuers that have passed health check
  - `unhealthyIssuers` map: Contains issuers that failed health check
- **Health Check Protocol**:
  - Perform `isHealthy()` check before first use of any issuer
  - No health checks needed for issuers already in `healthyIssuers` map
  - Periodically retry health checks for issuers in `unhealthyIssuers` map
- **State Transitions**:
  - Unhealthy → Healthy: Move issuer from unhealthy to healthy map when `isHealthy()` returns true
  - Healthy → Unhealthy: Keep in healthy map (assuming HTTP handlers only update in positive cases)
- **Token Processing**:
  - First attempt with issuers from `healthyIssuers` map
  - Fallback to checking `unhealthyIssuers` map with fresh health check
- **Thread Safety**: Both maps must be thread-safe for concurrent access
- **Metrics**: Track issuer state transitions and health check attempts

=== I2. WellKnownHandler Resilience Integration
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Implement the resilient `HttpHandler` composition in `WellKnownHandler` to use the new resilience patterns for well-known endpoint discovery.

*Rationale:* Well-known endpoint discovery is a critical path for JWT validation setup. Making this process resilient ensures better system reliability during identity provider maintenance or network issues.

*Implementation Requirements:*

- Integration with resilient HttpHandler composition
- Proper timeout and retry configuration
- Fallback mechanisms for discovery failures
- Caching of successfully discovered endpoints
- Health check integration for discovery status

=== I3. WellKnownHandlerJWKSKeyloader Implementation
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Create a new `WellKnownHandlerJWKSKeyloader` that uses delegation to handle the non-deterministic behavior of well-known endpoint discovery. This specialized `JwksLoader` implementation will properly integrate `WellKnownHandler` with the JWT validation system.

*Rationale:* The current approach of using `WellKnownHandler` directly for JWKS loading doesn't properly handle the lazy loading and resilience requirements. A dedicated `JwksLoader` implementation using delegation provides better separation of concerns and handles the non-deterministic nature of well-known discovery.

*Implementation Requirements:*

- Create `WellKnownHandlerJWKSKeyloader` implementing `JwksLoader` interface
- Use delegation pattern to wrap `WellKnownHandler` functionality
- Implement lazy initialization of well-known endpoints
- Handle discovery failures gracefully with proper fallback
- Cache discovered JWKS URI for subsequent requests
- Implement `isHealthy()` method that checks both discovery and JWKS availability
- Thread-safe implementation for concurrent access
- Clear error messages distinguishing discovery vs JWKS loading failures

== Implementation Considerations

=== API Changes

Since the project is pre-1.0, breaking changes are allowed and expected. No deprecation warnings or transitional implementations are needed. Changes should focus on creating the best possible API design without being constrained by backward compatibility concerns.

=== Performance Impact

Resilience patterns should be implemented with minimal performance overhead. Caching strategies should be employed to avoid repeated validation calls, and circuit breakers should fail fast when services are known to be unavailable.

=== Configuration Management

New configuration options should follow existing patterns and be properly documented. Default values should be chosen to provide good out-of-the-box behavior while allowing customization for specific environments.

=== Testing Strategy

Each enhancement should include comprehensive testing:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
- Chaos engineering tests for resilience validation
- Performance tests to ensure minimal overhead

== Dependencies and Research

=== Resilience4j Evaluation

Research should focus on:

- Core resilience4j modules (circuit breaker, retry, bulkhead)
- Integration with existing HTTP clients
- Configuration options and customization
- Performance characteristics
- Native image compatibility
- Minimal dependency footprint

=== Alternative Solutions

If Resilience4j proves unsuitable, evaluate:
- Custom implementation of basic resilience patterns
- Integration with other resilience libraries
- Cloud-native service mesh solutions
- HTTP client library built-in resilience features

== Success Criteria

=== Primary Goals

1. **Startup Resilience**: Applications should start successfully even when identity providers are temporarily unavailable
2. **Runtime Resilience**: JWT validation should gracefully handle temporary service outages with appropriate fallback behavior
3. **Health Visibility**: Operators should be able to monitor the health status of JWT validation components
4. **Configuration Consistency**: The enabled flag should work consistently across all layers of the system

=== Metrics for Success

- Application startup time and success rate in degraded network conditions
- JWT validation availability during identity provider outages
- Mean time to recovery for JWT validation after service restoration
- Configuration error detection and reporting accuracy

=== Integration Test Validation

**Critical Success Criteria**: The Quarkus integration tests must successfully validate the well-known discovery configuration:

- The file `cui-jwt-quarkus-parent/cui-jwt-quarkus-integration-tests/src/main/resources/application.properties` must be configured with the well-known variant for the Keycloak issuer
- The well-known discovery must properly resolve the JWKS endpoint from the Keycloak instance
- The final integration test command must pass without failures:
  ```bash
  ./mvnw clean verify -Pintegration-tests -pl cui-jwt-quarkus-parent/cui-jwt-quarkus-integration-tests
  ```
- All JWT validation tests using the well-known discovered configuration must succeed
- The test must verify that tokens issued by Keycloak are properly validated using the discovered JWKS endpoint

== Caffeine Cache Native Image Compatibility Issue

=== Issue Analysis

During integration testing, a critical compatibility issue was discovered between the Caffeine cache library and GraalVM native image compilation. The issue manifests as `ClassNotFoundException` for dynamically generated Caffeine cache implementation classes at runtime.

**Error Pattern:**
```
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.SSMSA
	at com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.LocalCacheFactory.newFactory(LocalCacheFactory.java:116)
```

**Root Cause:**
Caffeine generates cache implementation classes dynamically based on cache configuration features:
- S = Size-based eviction (maximumSize)
- M = Statistics tracking
- A = Access/Custom expiry policy
- W = Weak references

The specific class `SSMSA` indicates: Size + Statistics + Maximum + Access policy configuration.

=== Attempted Solutions

**1. BuildStep Reflection Registration:**
- Used `ReflectiveClassBuildItem.builder()` in Quarkus extension processor
- Registered multiple cache implementation class combinations
- **Result:** Failed - Classes still not found at runtime

**2. @RegisterForReflection Annotation:**
- Following Quarkus documentation recommendations
- Created dedicated configuration classes with `@RegisterForReflection(classNames = {...})`
- Placed in both deployment and runtime modules
- **Result:** Failed - Annotation processing did not resolve the issue

**3. Native Image Reflection Configuration:**
- Created `reflect-config.json` with comprehensive Caffeine class listings
- Used `NativeImageResourceBuildItem` to include configuration
- **Result:** Failed - JSON configuration not effective for dynamic classes

=== Technical Analysis

The fundamental issue is that Caffeine's `LocalCacheFactory` generates cache implementation classes at build time based on the specific combination of features used. These classes have names that follow a pattern but cannot be predicted statically, making it impossible to register them for reflection in advance.

**Cache Configuration in JwksCacheManager:**
```java
Caffeine<Object, Object> builder = Caffeine.newBuilder()
        .maximumSize(config.getMaxCacheSize());

if (config.getRefreshIntervalSeconds() > 0) {
    AdaptiveCacheExpiryPolicy expiryPolicy = new AdaptiveCacheExpiryPolicy(config, accessCount, hitCount);
    builder.expireAfter(expiryPolicy);
}

this.jwksCache = builder.build(cacheLoader::apply);
```

This configuration results in the `SSMSA` class generation, which is not available in the native image.

=== Required Solution

The Caffeine cache implementation must be replaced with a native-image compatible alternative as part of the resilience enhancement tasks. This aligns with the architectural changes outlined in tasks R1-R3 and H1-H2.

**Recommended Approaches:**
1. **Replace with Quarkus Cache Extension**: Use `@CacheResult` annotations with native-compatible implementations
2. **Custom Cache Implementation**: Implement a lightweight cache using `ConcurrentHashMap` with manual expiry
3. **Alternative Cache Library**: Evaluate native-compatible alternatives like Eclipse Collections or custom implementations

**Integration with Resilience Tasks:**
- Task R2 (Resilient HttpHandler Composition) should include cache replacement
- Task H1 (Health Check Implementation) must work with the new cache implementation
- Task H2 (Health Check Optimization) benefits from simpler, predictable cache behavior

=== Decision

The Caffeine cache library will be removed and replaced as part of the resilience enhancement implementation. This change is necessary for native image compatibility and aligns with the broader architectural improvements planned for the JWT validation system.

== Conclusion

These enhancements will significantly improve the robustness and operational characteristics of the CUI JWT validation system. By implementing proper resilience patterns, health checks, and configuration management, the system will be better suited for production environments where service availability cannot be guaranteed.

The replacement of the Caffeine cache library addresses a critical native image compatibility issue while providing an opportunity to implement a more resilient and maintainable caching strategy.

The phased approach allows for incremental implementation and testing, reducing the risk of introducing regressions while providing immediate value from each completed task.
