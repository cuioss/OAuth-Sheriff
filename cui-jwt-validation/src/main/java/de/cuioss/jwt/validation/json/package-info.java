/**
 * JSON mapping types for JWT validation using DSL-JSON.
 * <p>
 * This package contains pure mapper types for JSON deserialization using DSL-JSON's
 * compile-time code generation. All types follow a "nullable by default" pattern
 * for permissive JSON parsing - validation happens later in the validation chain.
 * <p>
 * Key characteristics:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>All record parameters are nullable (unspecified nullness)</li>
 *   <li>Optional accessor methods provide null-safe access</li>
 *   <li>No validation logic in mapper types</li>
 *   <li>DSL-JSON @CompiledJson annotations for performance</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The @NullUnmarked annotation removes JSpecify nullability enforcement,
 * allowing natural nullable-by-default behavior for JSON mapping scenarios.
 * 
 * @since 1.0
