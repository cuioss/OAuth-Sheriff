/**
 * Enum defining all measurement types for JWT validation pipeline steps.
 * <p>
 * Each measurement type represents a specific phase of the JWT validation process
 * that can be independently monitored and analyzed for metrics optimization.
 * <p>
 * The measurements follow the validation pipeline order:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #TOKEN_PARSING} - Basic JWT structure validation</li>
 *   <li>{@link #HEADER_VALIDATION} - Header claims validation</li>
 *   <li>{@link #SIGNATURE_VALIDATION} - Cryptographic verification (typically most expensive)</li>
 *   <li>{@link #CLAIMS_VALIDATION} - Token claims validation</li>
 *   <li>{@link #JWKS_OPERATIONS} - Key loading and caching</li>
 *   <li>{@link #COMPLETE_VALIDATION} - End-to-end validation including errors</li>
 * </ol>
