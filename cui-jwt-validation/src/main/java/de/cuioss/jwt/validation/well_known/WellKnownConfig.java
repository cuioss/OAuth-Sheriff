/**
 * Configuration class for well-known endpoint operations.
 * <p>
 * This class provides configuration options for well-known endpoint discovery,
 * such as HTTP timeout settings and retry behavior.
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * <pre>
 * WellKnownConfig config = WellKnownConfig.builder()
 *     .connectTimeoutSeconds(5)
 *     .readTimeoutSeconds(10)
 *     .maxAttempts(3)
 *     .build();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Implements requirements:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><a href="https://github.com/cuioss/cui-jwt/tree/main/doc/Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-4">CUI-JWT-4: Key Management</a></li>
 * </ul>
