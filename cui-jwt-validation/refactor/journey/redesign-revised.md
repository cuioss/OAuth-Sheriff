# Revised Architecture Decision

## Critical Realization

After analyzing the actual code flow, the complex `JwksLoadingOrchestrator` pattern is over-engineering. The `IssuerConfigResolver` already acts as a central manager for all issuer configurations.

## Actual vs Proposed Architecture

### What We Have (And Should Keep)

```
TokenValidator
    ↓
IssuerConfigResolver  ← Central management point (already exists!)
    ↓
IssuerConfig
    ↓
HttpJwksLoader
    ↓
ResilientHttpHandler
```

### What We Proposed (Too Complex)

```
TokenValidator
    ↓
JwksLoadingOrchestrator  ← New abstraction layer
    ↓
[Complex new components]
    ↓
ResilientHttpHandler
```

## The Better Solution

Enhance `IssuerConfigResolver` to trigger asynchronous JWKS loading. This is a natural fit because:

1. **It already manages all IssuerConfigs** - Perfect place for orchestration
2. **It controls initialization** - Can trigger async loads at the right time
3. **It has lazy resolution** - Knows when configs are first accessed
4. **No new abstractions needed** - Work with existing architecture

## Why We Went Wrong

1. **Didn't fully understand existing architecture** - IssuerConfigResolver was already doing orchestration
2. **Started from scratch instead of enhancing** - Classic over-engineering mistake
3. **Created parallel management** - Orchestrator duplicated resolver's responsibilities
4. **Ignored existing patterns** - The loadAsync() method already exists in HttpJwksLoader

## The Right Approach

See `redesign-simplified.md` for the better solution that:
- Enhances IssuerConfigResolver to trigger async loading
- Adds minimal changes to HttpJwksLoader
- Removes JwksStartupService (no longer needed)
- Works within existing architecture
- Achieves all goals with much less complexity

## Lessons Learned

1. **Understand existing architecture first** - Don't redesign what you don't understand
2. **Enhance, don't replace** - Work with existing patterns when possible
3. **Simpler is better** - Complex orchestrators aren't always the answer
4. **Look for natural integration points** - IssuerConfigResolver was already the right place

## Recommendation

**Abandon the orchestrator pattern. Enhance IssuerConfigResolver instead.**

This achieves all our goals:
- ✅ Async JWKS loading
- ✅ Lock-free status checks
- ✅ Key rotation with grace period
- ✅ Framework independence
- ✅ Minimal code changes
- ✅ Lower risk

The simpler solution is the better solution.
