# JWT Validation Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Task Completion Process (Mandatory for Each Task)

After implementing any task, **strictly follow this completion process**:

1. **Quality Verification**: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify -pl cui-jwt-validation`
   - ⚠️ **Do not cancel** - let it run through completely
   - ⚠️ **Examine all build output** - read every warning and error
   - ⚠️ **Fix ALL failures/errors/warnings** (mandatory) - no shortcuts allowed

2. **Handle Build Artifacts**:
   - Some recipes may add markers - either fix them or suppress with proper justification
   - **Never commit markers** - they must be resolved
   - Address code quality, formatting, and linting issues

3. **Final Verification**: `./mvnw clean install -pl cui-jwt-validation`
   - Must complete without errors or warnings
   - All tests must pass

4. **Update Progress**: Mark task as completed `[x]` in this plan.md

5. **Commit**: After verified build, commit changes with task identifier in message

## High Priority Tasks

### T1. Add Async Initialization Tests
[ ] **Priority:** High

**Description:** Create comprehensive tests for new async initialization behavior: constructor non-blocking, CompletableFuture handling, well-known discovery in async context. Do comply to project standards, especially the usage of awaitility.

**Rationale:** New async functionality must be thoroughly tested to prevent regressions and ensure correct behavior.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/test-driven-approach.md` (Async Initialization section)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/jwks/http/HttpJwksLoaderTest.java`

---

### T2. Add Lock-Free Status Check Tests
[ ] **Priority:** High

**Description:** Implement high-contention concurrent tests to verify status checks are truly lock-free and atomic state transitions work correctly.

**Rationale:** Lock-free behavior is critical for health checks and system performance. Must be verified under concurrent load.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/test-driven-approach.md` (Lock-Free Status Tests)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/IssuerConfigResolverConcurrencyTest.java`

---

### S1. Validate Framework Independence
[ ] **Priority:** High

**Description:** Verify that refactored implementation maintains framework independence and works correctly in Quarkus, NiFi, and plain Java environments.

**Rationale:** Critical requirement to maintain multi-framework compatibility. Must not break existing NiFi deployments.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/analyzis.md` (Framework Independence Requirement)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/consistency-analysis.md` (Framework Independence verification)

---

## Medium Priority Tasks

### T4. Add IssuerConfigResolver Async Loading Tests
[ ] **Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Test enhanced IssuerConfigResolver: constructor triggers async loading, only returns healthy configs, CompletableFuture management, timeout handling.

**Rationale:** IssuerConfigResolver is now central to async loading coordination. Its behavior must be thoroughly tested.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/test-driven-approach.md` (IssuerConfigResolver Async Loading section)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/redesign.md` (Enhanced IssuerConfigResolver)

---

### T5. Extend Background Refresh Error Handling Tests
[ ] **Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Add tests for specific exception handling in background refresh: IOException, JwksParseException, InvalidKeySpecException. Verify no generic RuntimeException handling.

**Rationale:** Background refresh error handling was improved to use specific exceptions. This must be tested to ensure proper error recovery.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/test-driven-approach.md` (Background Refresh Extended Tests)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/httpjwksloader-clean.md` (background refresh error handling)

---

### P2. Validate Non-Blocking Startup Performance
[ ] **Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Measure and verify that constructor-based initialization no longer blocks application startup. Compare startup times before and after refactoring.

**Rationale:** Non-blocking startup is a key architectural improvement. Must be verified to ensure goal is achieved.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/httpjwksloader-clean.md` (constructor simplicity)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/test-driven-approach.md` (constructor timing tests)

---

### DOC1. Update API Documentation for Async Changes
[ ] **Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Update JavaDoc for JwksLoader interface and HttpJwksLoader to reflect new async initialization pattern and CompletableFuture usage. Do not be verbose, but focussed.
While at it, simplify and clarify existing documentation. It is too verbose already.

**Rationale:** API changes require updated documentation for developers using the library.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/redesign.md` (interface changes)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/jwks/JwksLoader.java`

---

### S2. Verify ResilientHttpHandler Integration
[ ] **Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Ensure that new implementation properly leverages existing ResilientHttpHandler capabilities without reimplementing retry logic.

**Rationale:** Must not duplicate existing resilience functionality. ResilientHttpHandler provides critical caching and retry capabilities.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/analyzis.md` (ResilientHttpHandler analysis)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/httpjwksloader-clean.md` (ResilientHttpHandler usage)
