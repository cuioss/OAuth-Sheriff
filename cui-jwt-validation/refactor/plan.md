# JWT Validation Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Task Completion Process (Mandatory for Each Task)

After implementing any task, **strictly follow this completion process**:

1. **Quality Verification**: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify -pl cui-jwt-validation`
   - ⚠️ **Do not cancel** - let it run through completely
   - ⚠️ **Examine all build output** - read every warning and error
   - ⚠️ **Fix ALL failures/errors/warnings** (mandatory) - no shortcuts allowed

2. **Handle Build Artifacts**:
   - Some recipes may add markers - either fix them or suppress with proper justification
   - **Never commit markers** - they must be resolved
   - Address code quality, formatting, and linting issues

3. **Final Verification**: `./mvnw clean install -pl cui-jwt-validation`
   - Must complete without errors or warnings
   - All tests must pass

4. **Update Progress**: Mark task as completed `[x]` in this plan.md

5. **Commit**: After verified build, commit changes with task identifier in message

## High Priority Tasks

---

### S1. Validate Framework Independence
[ ] **Priority:** High

**Description:** Verify that refactored implementation maintains framework independence and works correctly in Quarkus, NiFi, and plain Java environments.

**Rationale:** Critical requirement to maintain multi-framework compatibility. Must not break existing NiFi deployments.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/analyzis.md` (Framework Independence Requirement)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/consistency-analysis.md` (Framework Independence verification)

---

## Medium Priority Tasks

### T4. Add IssuerConfigResolver Async Loading Tests
[ ] **Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Test enhanced IssuerConfigResolver: constructor triggers async loading, only returns healthy configs, CompletableFuture management, timeout handling.
Do comply to project standards, especially the usage of awaitility.

**Rationale:** IssuerConfigResolver is now central to async loading coordination. Its behavior must be thoroughly tested.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/test-driven-approach.md` (IssuerConfigResolver Async Loading section)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/redesign.md` (Enhanced IssuerConfigResolver)

---

### T5. Extend Background Refresh Error Handling Tests
[ ] **Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Add tests for specific exception handling in background refresh: IOException, JwksParseException, InvalidKeySpecException. Verify no generic RuntimeException handling.
Use by leveraging existing test structure. Especially [JwksResolveDispatcher.java](../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/test/dispatcher/JwksResolveDispatcher.java)
Do comply to project standards, especially the usage of awaitility.

**Rationale:** Background refresh error handling was improved to use specific exceptions. This must be tested to ensure proper error recovery.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/test-driven-approach.md` (Background Refresh Extended Tests)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/httpjwksloader-clean.md` (background refresh error handling)

---

### P2. Validate Non-Blocking Startup Performance
[x] **Priority:** Medium

**Description:** Measure and verify that constructor-based initialization no longer blocks application startup. Compare startup times before and after refactoring.

**Rationale:** Non-blocking startup is a key architectural improvement. Must be verified to ensure goal is achieved.

**Required Reading:**
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/httpjwksloader-clean.md` (constructor simplicity)
- `/Users/oliver/git/cui-jwt/cui-jwt-validation/refactor/test-driven-approach.md` (constructor timing tests)
