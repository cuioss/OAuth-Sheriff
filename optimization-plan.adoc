== Executive Summary

=== Current Performance Results

- **JWT Validation**: 265.9ms P95 (918 req/sec) - JFR-enabled native image with RS256
- **Health Check**: 27.2ms P95 (13,520 req/sec) - System baseline
- **JWT Processing Overhead**: 238.7ms (265.9ms - 27.2ms = JWT validation overhead)
- **Infrastructure**: Apple M4, containerized Quarkus native runtime with JFR support

=== ES256 Investigation Results (July 21, 2025)

**Algorithm Migration Status**: ✅ Keycloak Configuration Complete, ❌ JWT Library Compatibility Issue

**Key Findings**:

- **Keycloak ES256 Support**: ✅ Successfully configured to generate ES256 tokens
- **Token Verification**: ✅ ES256 tokens generated with correct algorithm header (`"alg": "ES256"`)
- **cui-jwt Library Algorithm Support**: ✅ **ES256 is supported** (3rd priority in SignatureAlgorithmPreferences)
- **Root Cause Identified**: ❌ **ECDSA signature format incompatibility** between Keycloak and JDK
- **Technical Issue**: Keycloak uses IEEE P1363 format (JWT standard), JDK expects ASN.1/DER format
- **Error Details**: `ECUtil.decodeSignature()` fails with "Invalid encoding for signature" and "Invalid lenByte"
- **Performance Measurement**: Cannot benchmark ES256 performance until signature format conversion implemented

**Critical Blocker**: The cui-jwt-validation library needs signature format conversion from IEEE P1363 to ASN.1/DER format for ECDSA signatures, preventing the expected 95%+ performance improvement from algorithm migration until resolved.

=== JFR Analysis Results (July 21, 2025)

**Performance Breakdown from JFR Native Image Analysis:**

- **RSA Signature Verification**: ~230ms (97% of JWT overhead)
- **JWT Parsing/Validation Logic**: ~5-8ms
- **Other Overhead**: ~1-3ms (logging, metrics, etc.)

**Root Cause**: RSA signature verification (`BigInteger.modPow()` operations) is the primary bottleneck in GraalVM native images.

=== Performance Targets

Based on JFR analysis showing RSA as the primary bottleneck:

- **Current Performance**: 265.9ms P95 (918 req/sec) with RS256
- **Target with Algorithm Optimization**: 35-50ms P95 (>5000 req/sec) with ES256/EdDSA
- **Breakdown Target**: 27.2ms (system) + 5-10ms (crypto) + 5-8ms (JWT library) = 37-45ms P95
- **Throughput Target**: >5000 ops/s (achievable with optimized crypto algorithm)

**Critical Path**: Cryptographic algorithm optimization is the key to achieving target performance. Infrastructure and JWT library are already optimized.

== Completed Optimizations

=== JFR Native Image Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**

Successfully implemented JFR support using dual-image approach with UBI-based containers for profiling.

**Current Status:**

- ✅ Multi-stage Docker build with Mandrel builder + dual runtime options
- ✅ Conditional JFR support via `ENABLE_JFR` build argument
- ✅ Runtime JFR configuration via `JFR_OPTS` environment variable
- ✅ Native executable built with `--enable-monitoring=heapdump,jfr`
- ✅ **JFR file generation working in UBI-based containers**
- ✅ **JFR recordings successfully collected for analysis (225KB file)**

**Solution**: Simplified Maven profiles (`integration-tests` and `jfr`) provide clean separation between production (distroless) and profiling (UBI-based) images with full JFR support.

=== Benchmark Infrastructure Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**

Successfully implemented Maven-based benchmark execution with JFR profiling capabilities.

**Current Status:**

- ✅ **Maven Benchmark Profiles**: Created `benchmark-testing` and `benchmark-jfr` profiles
- ✅ **JFR Integration**: Automated JFR recording collection during benchmarks
- ✅ **Performance Baseline**: Established health check baseline (27.2ms P95, 13,520 req/sec)
- ✅ **JWT Validation Metrics**: Measured JWT validation performance (265.9ms P95, 918 req/sec)
- ✅ **Root Cause Identification**: JFR analysis identified RSA as primary bottleneck

**Solution**: Maven-driven benchmark execution with automated JFR profiling provides comprehensive performance analysis capabilities.

=== Infrastructure Optimization ✅ **COMPLETED**

Significant performance improvements through Docker optimization:

- **Docker resource limits**: Memory 256MB→512MB, CPU 1.0→2.0 cores
- **wrk configuration**: Optimized from 6 threads/180 connections to 4 threads/80 connections
- **Health check improvement**: Reduced to 24.4ms P95 (system baseline)
- **Benchmark infrastructure**: Streamlined to profile-based execution

=== Tool Replacement and Real Token Enforcement ✅ **COMPLETED**

- Docker-based wrk solution implemented, replaced JMH for integration testing
- All mock token fallbacks removed, real token validation enforced
- Benchmark calculations verified - no calculation errors found

=== TLS/HTTPS Optimization ✅ **VERIFIED EXCELLENT**

HTTP vs HTTPS comparison test results (from earlier testing):

- HTTP P95 latency: 35.8ms
- HTTPS P95 latency: 33.9ms
- **Result**: HTTPS performs as well as HTTP (no TLS bottleneck)
- **Conclusion**: TLS is not a performance bottleneck in current setup

== Performance Analysis Summary

=== Key Insights

1. **System Baseline**: 27.2ms P95 (health check) - This is the infrastructure baseline
2. **JWT Processing**: 238.7ms additional overhead (265.9ms - 27.2ms)
3. **JWT Library**: ~5-8ms (micro-benchmark confirmed)
4. **RSA Signature Verification**: ~230ms (97% of JWT processing overhead) - **IDENTIFIED VIA JFR**

=== Bottleneck Analysis

**Current Performance Breakdown from JFR Native Image Analysis:**

- **System Infrastructure**: 27.2ms (Docker, networking, HTTP processing)
- **RSA Signature Verification**: ~230ms (BigInteger.modPow operations)
- **JWT Parsing/Validation**: ~5-8ms (library logic)
- **Other Overhead**: ~1-3ms (logging, metrics, etc.)
- **Total**: 265.9ms P95

**Critical Finding**: JFR analysis definitively identified RSA signature verification as the primary bottleneck, consuming 97% of JWT validation time in GraalVM native images.

**JFR Evidence**: Stack traces consistently show `java.math.BigInteger.modPow()`, `sun.security.rsa.RSACore.crypt()`, and `de.cuioss.jwt.validation.pipeline.TokenSignatureValidator.verifySignature()` as the dominant CPU consumers during benchmark execution.

== Next Steps - Actionable Tasks

**Status**: COMPLETED - ES256 configuration successful but cui-jwt library compatibility issue identified

**Critical Findings**:

* **Technical Evidence**: `ECUtil.decodeSignature()` fails with "Invalid encoding" due to format mismatch
* **Performance Impact**: Cannot measure ES256 performance until signature format conversion implemented

**Next Actions Required**:

2. **Alternative Library Evaluation** - Consider JWT libraries with built-in ECDSA format handling
3. **Implementation Path Decision** - Fix cui-jwt signature handling vs migrate to alternative library
4. **Performance Validation** - Benchmark ES256 performance after signature format issue resolved

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive analysis of OAuth asymmetric algorithms with GraalVM native image performance characteristics

==== Task 1.3: GraalVM RSA Optimization Investigation ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Goal**: Investigate either GraalVM RSA performance optimization or alternative JCA implementations

**Investigation Paths**:

- [x] **GraalVM Analysis**: Confirmed native image RSA performance degradation due to missing JIT optimization

**Key Findings**:

- **Root Cause**: GraalVM native images lack JIT optimization, causing 5x+ RSA performance degradation
- **Best JCA Option**: Jipher JCE (Enterprise only) provides OpenSSL 3.0 integration
- **BouncyCastle**: Viable but complex configuration, no performance benchmarks available
- **Conscrypt**: Not recommended due to compatibility issues with GraalVM native image
- **Build Optimizations**: -O3, PGO provide 15-20% improvement but won't solve fundamental RSA issue

**Primary Recommendation**: **Algorithm migration is more effective than JCA provider optimization**
