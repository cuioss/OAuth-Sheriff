/**
 * Interceptor-based Bearer token validation for declarative security.
 * <p>
 * This package provides CDI interceptor support for automatic Bearer token validation
 * at method level using the {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.oauth.quarkus.annotation.BearerAuth} annotation.
 * <p>
 * The interceptor validates Bearer tokens and automatically returns error responses for
 * failed validation. Validated token details can be accessed via {@link de.cuioss.sheriff.oauth.quarkus.annotation.BearerToken}
 * parameter injection.
 * <p>
 * The interceptor pattern complements the existing producer pattern, providing
 * developers with a choice between explicit validation (producer) and declarative
 * validation (interceptor).
 *
 * @author Oliver Wolff
 * @since 1.0
