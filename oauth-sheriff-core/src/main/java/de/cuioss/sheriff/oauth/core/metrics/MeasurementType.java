/**
 * Enum defining all measurement types for JWT validation pipeline steps.
 * <p>
 * Each measurement type represents a specific phase of the JWT validation process
 * that can be independently monitored and analyzed for performance optimization.
 * <p>
 * The enum constants are ordered by their execution sequence in the validation pipeline (ordinals 0-14).
 * This natural ordering makes it easy to identify pipeline flow and bottlenecks by ordinal value.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Pipeline Execution Order (Access Token):</strong>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>COMPLETE_VALIDATION (0) - Wraps entire validation</li>
 *   <li>TOKEN_FORMAT_CHECK (1) - Pre-pipeline string validation</li>
 *   <li>TOKEN_PARSING (2) - Decode Base64URL and parse JSON</li>
 *   <li>ISSUER_EXTRACTION (3) - Extract issuer claim</li>
 *   <li>CACHE_LOOKUP (4) - Check cache before expensive operations</li>
 *   <li>ISSUER_CONFIG_RESOLUTION (5) - Resolve issuer configuration</li>
 *   <li>HEADER_VALIDATION (6) - Validate JWT header</li>
 *   <li>SIGNATURE_VALIDATION (7) - Cryptographic verification (most expensive)</li>
 *   <li>TOKEN_BUILDING (8) - Build typed token object</li>
 *   <li>CLAIMS_VALIDATION (9) - Validate token claims</li>
 *   <li>CACHE_STORE (10) - Store validated token in cache</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Cross-Cutting Concerns:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>JWKS_OPERATIONS (11) - Key loading (happens within signature validation)</li>
 *   <li>RETRY_ATTEMPT (12) - Individual retry attempts</li>
 *   <li>RETRY_COMPLETE (13) - Complete retry cycle with delays</li>
 *   <li>RETRY_DELAY (14) - Exponential backoff delay timing</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Pipeline Usage:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>AccessTokenValidationPipeline</strong>: Uses ordinals 0-10 for complete instrumentation</li>
 *   <li><strong>IdTokenValidationPipeline</strong>: No metrics (uses NoOpMetricsTicker)</li>
 *   <li><strong>RefreshTokenValidationPipeline</strong>: No metrics (uses NoOpMetricsTicker)</li>
 * </ul>
