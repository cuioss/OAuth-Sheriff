== Summary

The JWT validation library has achieved **66% throughput improvement** (90,347 ops/s) with excellent median performance (57Œºs) through architectural optimizations and thread tuning.

**Key Results**:
1. **Architecture**: Field-based validators, Provider bypass, immutable patterns
2. **Thread Optimization**: 100 threads optimal (903 ops/s/thread vs 387 with 200 threads)
3. **Component Performance**: Signature (61Œºs), Building (12Œºs), Parsing (7Œºs), Claims (5Œºs)
4. **Error Handling**: Superior performance with 155k ops/s at 50% error rate

**Critical Issues**:
- P99 latency (27.3ms) needs reduction to <5ms
- JFR overhead (65%) unsuitable for production
- High variance ratios (255-520x) indicate instability

**Next Steps**: 
1. Implement signature caching (Phase 1) - expected 30-40% improvement
2. Add object pooling for token builders - reduce P99 from 3.7ms to <1ms
3. Optimize JFR instrumentation - reduce overhead from 65% to <20%
4. Consider async architecture for 100k+ ops/s target

**Production Readiness**: Conditionally ready - suitable for standard web applications but requires optimization for stringent SLAs (<5ms P99).
