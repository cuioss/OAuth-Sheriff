== âœ… Implemented Optimizations

=== Completed Tasks (Compressed Summary)

**Architecture & Performance (Phases 1-3)**:

- âœ… Field-based TokenSignatureValidator with Provider bypass optimization - eliminated 73.7% signature validation bottleneck (+33% improvement)
- âœ… Virtual thread compatibility with ReentrantLock patterns, immutable Map.copyOf() throughout - zero ThreadLocal usage
- âœ… JFR instrumentation with variance analysis, ValidationContext time caching - eliminated 27+ system calls

**Library Analysis**:

- âœ… Analyzed jjwt, smallrye-jwt, jose4j, auth0 - all use JCA without Signature caching, identified Provider.getService() contention
- âœ… Benchmark profile separation - standard vs JFR benchmarks now properly isolated

== Summary

The JWT validation library has achieved **69% throughput improvement** through three optimization phases:

1. **Architecture**: Field-based validators, Provider bypass, immutable patterns
2. **Performance**: 91,950 ops/s (up from 54,516), signature validation 33% faster
3. **Compatibility**: Full virtual thread support, zero ThreadLocal usage

**Next focus**: Signature result caching for additional 20-30% gains, optimal thread count determination, and production load validation.
