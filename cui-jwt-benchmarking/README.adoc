This module contains benchmarking code for the JWT token validation library. It uses JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) to measure performance of various components.

== Overview

The benchmarking module provides performance measurements for key components of the JWT validation library:

* Token validation performance (average time and throughput)
* JWKS key retrieval performance  
* Multi-issuer validation performance
* Error handling performance
* Concurrent validation performance
* **Performance Score**: A weighted metric combining throughput and latency

== Running Benchmarks Manually

Benchmarks are configured to be skipped by default to prevent them from slowing down regular builds. To run the benchmarks manually, you need to explicitly enable them.

=== Using Maven Command Line

To run benchmarks from the command line:

[source,bash]
----
# From the project root directory
./mvnw clean verify -pl cui-jwt-benchmarking -Dskip.benchmark=false

# With custom JMH parameters
./mvnw clean verify -pl cui-jwt-benchmarking -Dskip.benchmark=false \
  -Djmh.iterations=5 \
  -Djmh.warmupIterations=3 \
  -Djmh.forks=2 \
  -Djmh.threads=4
----

=== JMH Parameters

You can customize the benchmark execution with the following JMH parameters:

* `jmh.iterations` - Number of measurement iterations (default: 5)
* `jmh.warmupIterations` - Number of warmup iterations (default: 3)
* `jmh.forks` - Number of JVM forks (default: 2)
* `jmh.threads` - Number of threads (default: 4)
* `jmh.result.format` - Result format (default: JSON)
* `jmh.result.filePrefix` - Result file prefix

=== Running Specific Benchmarks

To run specific benchmarks, you can use the `jmh.includes` parameter:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify -pl cui-jwt-benchmarking -Dskip.benchmark=false \
  -Djmh.includes=TokenValidatorBenchmark
----

== Benchmark Results

After running the benchmarks, results will be available in the `target` directory. If you've configured JSON output, you can visualize the results using the HTML visualizer template included in this module.

== Benchmark Classes

=== TokenValidatorBenchmark

Measures the performance of token validation operations.

=== JwksClientBenchmark

Measures the performance of JWKS key retrieval operations.

=== MultiIssuerValidatorBenchmark

Measures the performance of multi-issuer token validation.

=== ErrorLoadBenchmark

Measures the performance impact of error handling.

=== ConcurrentTokenValidationBenchmark

Measures the performance of concurrent token validation.

== GitHub Actions Integration

This module is configured to run benchmarks automatically via GitHub Actions:

* On merges to the main branch
* On version tag pushes
* Manually via workflow dispatch

Results are published to GitHub Pages for visualization and comparison over time.

== Performance Scoring System

The benchmarking module includes a comprehensive performance scoring system that combines multiple metrics into a single indicator. This system focuses on the two most critical performance aspects:

=== Key Metrics

**Token Throughput**: Operations per second under concurrent load (60% weight)

**Average Validation Time**: Microseconds per operation in single-threaded scenarios (40% weight)

=== Weighted Score Calculation

The performance score uses the formula:
```
Score = (Throughput × 0.6) + ((1,000,000 ÷ AvgTime) × 0.4)
```

This provides a balanced view where higher throughput and lower latency both contribute positively to the score.

=== Performance Badge

The system automatically generates a performance badge displayed in the main README that shows:
- The weighted performance score
- Raw throughput value (operations/second)  
- Raw average time value (microseconds)

Example: `Performance Score: 32000 (45k ops/s, 80μs)`
