/**
 * Token caching infrastructure for JWT validation performance optimization.
 * <p>
 * This package provides caching functionality to avoid redundant validation of
 * the same access tokens. The cache implementation is thread-safe, uses SHA-256
 * hashing for keys, and includes automatic expiration handling.
 * <p>
 * Key features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Thread-safe caching with configurable size limits</li>
 *   <li>LRU eviction policy for size management</li>
 *   <li>Automatic expiration checking and background cleanup</li>
 *   <li>Security event tracking for cache effectiveness monitoring</li>
 *   <li>No external dependencies (Quarkus compatible)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @since 1.0
