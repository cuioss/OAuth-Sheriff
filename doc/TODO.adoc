== Documentation Enhancement

=== 1. JWT Attack Mitigation Documentation

*Priority:* High
*Status:* [x] COMPLETED

*Description:*
Enhance the security documentation to clearly describe how the library mitigates each of the common JWT attacks.

*Related to:* link:security/jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc[JWT Attacks Analysis]

*Implementation Plan:*

1. [x] Update `doc/security/security-specifications.adoc` to reference the PentesterLab article
2. [x] Create a new section for each attack vector
3. [x] Document the mitigation approach implemented in the library
4. [x] Link to relevant test classes that verify the mitigation and or documentation
5. [x] Update the corresponding sections in link:security/jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc[jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc] to ensure consistency
6. [x] Commit the changes to git with a meaningful commit message

*References:*

=== 2. OAuth Security Considerations Documentation

*Priority:* High
*Status:* [x] COMPLETED

*Description:*
Enhance the security documentation to clearly describe how the library addresses OAuth-specific security considerations.

*Related to:* link:security/oauth-security-analysis.adoc[OAuth Security Analysis]

*Implementation Plan:*

1. [x] Update `doc/security/security-specifications.adoc` to reference the Doyensec article
2. [x] Create a new section for each OAuth vulnerability
3. [x] Document the mitigation approach implemented in the library
4. [x] Link to relevant test classes and or documentation that verify the mitigation
5. [x] Update the corresponding sections in link:security/oauth-security-analysis.adoc[oauth-security-analysis.adoc] to ensure consistency
6. [x] Commit the changes to git with a meaningful commit message

=== 3. JWT Security Best Practices Guide

*Priority:* Medium
*Status:* [ ] TODO

*Description:*
Create a comprehensive guide for users of the library on JWT security best practices.

*Related to:* link:security/jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc[JWT Attacks Analysis] and link:security/oauth-security-analysis.adoc[OAuth Security Analysis]

*Implementation Plan:*

1. [ ] Create a new document `doc/jwt-security-best-practices.adoc`
2. [ ] Include sections on:
** Secure token handling on the client
** Proper configuration of the library
** Key management best practices
** Logging and monitoring recommendations
** Common misconfigurations to avoid
3. [ ] Run `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify` to fix all javadoc warnings if there are any
4. [ ] Cross-reference with link:security/jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc[jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc] and link:security/oauth-security-analysis.adoc[oauth-security-analysis.adoc]
5. [ ] Commit the changes to git with a meaningful commit message

== Implementation Enhancements

=== 1. Enhanced JWK Header Validation

*Priority:* Medium
*Status:* [ ] TODO

*Description:*
Implement explicit validation and rejection of embedded JWK, JKU, and X5U headers in tokens.

*Related to:* link:security/jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc#_6_embedded_jwk_cve_2018_0114[Embedded JWK Attack] and link:security/jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc#_7_jku_x5u_header_abuse[JKU/X5U Header Abuse]

*Implementation Plan:*

1. [ ] Update `TokenHeaderValidator` to explicitly check for and reject these headers
2. [ ] Add appropriate security events for attempted attacks
3. [ ] Ensure proper logging of rejection events
4. [ ] Run `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify` to fix all javadoc warnings if there are any
5. [ ] Update the corresponding sections in link:security/jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc[jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc]: Set status to MITIGATED and link the corresponding implementation
6. [ ] Commit the changes to git with a meaningful commit message

*References:*
* https://pentesterlab.com/blog/jwt-vulnerabilities-attacks-guide


=== 2. Enhanced Scope Validation

*Priority:* Medium
*Status:* [ ] TODO

*Description:*
Improve the scope validation capabilities to better protect against scope upgrade attacks.

*Related to:* link:security/oauth-security-analysis.adoc#_scope_upgrade_attack[Scope Upgrade Attack]

*Implementation Plan:*

1. [ ] Document best practices for scope validation in client applications
2. [ ] Update the corresponding section in link:security/oauth-security-analysis.adoc[oauth-security-analysis.adoc]: Set status to MITIGATED and link the corresponding implementation
3. [ ] Commit the changes to git with a meaningful commit message
