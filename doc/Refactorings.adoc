== Overview

This document outlines the plan to improve the `HttpJwksLoader` and `JWKSKeyLoader` classes to enhance performance, reliability, and caching capabilities. The refactoring aims to implement HTTP 304 "Not Modified" handling, content-based caching, and fallback mechanisms to improve the efficiency and resilience of JWKS key loading.

== Current Structure

=== Class Hierarchy
* `JwksLoader` (interface): Defines methods for retrieving key information
* `JWKSKeyLoader` (implements `JwksLoader`): Parses JWKS content and extracts keys
* `HttpJwksLoader` (implements `JwksLoader`): Loads JWKS from an HTTP endpoint and caches the results

=== Current Caching Mechanism
* `HttpJwksLoader` uses Caffeine cache with configurable expiration
* Cache is refreshed based on time intervals only
* No content-based caching or HTTP 304 handling
* No fallback mechanism for failed requests

== Refactoring Steps

=== Step 1: Enhance JWKSKeyLoader
* [x] Add originalString field to store the original JWKS content:
  * [x] Add a private final field `private final String originalString;`
  * [x] Initialize it in the constructor
  * [x] Add a getter method `public String getOriginalString()`

* [x] Add etag field to store the ETag value from HTTP responses:
  * [x] Add a private final field `private final String etag;`
  * [x] Update the constructor to accept an etag parameter
  * [x] Add a getter method `public String getEtag()`

* [x] Add isNotEmpty() method to check if the loader contains valid keys:
  * [x] Implement `public boolean isNotEmpty()` that returns true if keyInfoMap is not empty

* [x] Update equals/hashCode to consider the new fields:
  * [x] Update the `@EqualsAndHashCode` annotation to include the new fields
  * [x] Update the `@ToString` annotation to include the new fields

=== Step 2: Enhance HttpJwksLoader
* [x] Add lastValidResult field to store the last valid JWKSKeyLoader instance:
  * [x] Add a private volatile field `private volatile JWKSKeyLoader lastValidResult;`
  * [x] Initialize it to null in the constructor

* [x] Modify loadJwksKeyLoader to implement HTTP 304 "Not Modified" handling:
  * [x] Store the ETag from successful responses
  * [x] Include the ETag in subsequent requests using the If-None-Match header
  * [x] Handle 304 responses by returning the previously cached result

* [x] Implement content-based caching:
  * [x] Compare the content of the new response with the stored originalString
  * [x] Return the previously created JWKSKeyLoader if the content hasn't changed
  * [x] Only create a new JWKSKeyLoader if the content has actually changed

* [x] Implement fallback to last valid result:
  * [x] If a new request fails but there's a valid cached result, return the cached result
  * [x] Log a warning when falling back to the cached result
  * [x] Only return an empty result if there's no valid cached result

=== Step 3: Update Documentation
* [x] Update all documentation to reflect the changes:
  * [x] Update Javadoc in all modified classes
  * [x] Update specification documents under `doc/specification`
  * [x] Update README.adoc

=== Step 4: Clean-Up Code
* [x] Run the Maven rewrite plugins to clean up the code:
  * [x] Run `./mvnw -Prewrite-modernize rewrite:run`
  * [x] Verify with `./mvnw clean install`
  * [x] Fix any issues and commit
  * [x] Run `./mvnw -Prewrite-prepare-release rewrite:run`
  * [x] Verify with `./mvnw clean install`
  * [x] Fix any issues and commit

== Verification Steps

* [x] For each major step:
  * [x] Run Maven build to verify the changes: `./mvnw clean install`
  * [x] Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
  * [x] Commit each verified step

== Implementation Details

=== JWKSKeyLoader Enhancements
* [x] The `JWKSKeyLoader` class will need to be updated with the following:
  * [x] Add `originalString` field to store the original JWKS content
  * [x] Add `etag` field to store the ETag value from HTTP responses
  * [x] Update constructor to accept an etag parameter: `public JWKSKeyLoader(String jwksContent, String etag)`
  * [x] Add a default constructor that sets etag to null: `public JWKSKeyLoader(String jwksContent)`
  * [x] Add `isNotEmpty()` method to check if the loader contains valid keys
  * [x] Update equals/hashCode to consider the new fields

=== HttpJwksLoader Enhancements
* [x] The `HttpJwksLoader` class will need to be updated with the following:
  * [x] Add `lastValidResult` field to store the last valid JWKSKeyLoader instance
  * [x] Update `loadJwksKeyLoader` method to:
    * [x] Include the ETag in requests using the If-None-Match header if available
    * [x] Handle 304 responses by returning the previously cached result
    * [x] Compare content and only create a new JWKSKeyLoader if content has changed
    * [x] Store the ETag from successful responses
    * [x] Implement fallback to last valid result if a new request fails
  * [x] Update `resolve` method to handle the fallback mechanism

=== HTTP 304 "Not Modified" Handling
* [x] The implementation will follow these steps:
  * [x] Store the ETag from successful responses in the JWKSKeyLoader
  * [x] Include the ETag in subsequent requests using the If-None-Match header
  * [x] If the server responds with 304 Not Modified, return the previously cached result
  * [x] If the server responds with 200 OK and new content, update the cache

=== Content-Based Caching
* [x] The implementation will follow these steps:
  * [x] Compare the content of the new response with the stored originalString
  * [x] If the content is the same, return the previously created JWKSKeyLoader
  * [x] If the content is different, create a new JWKSKeyLoader with the new content

=== Fallback Mechanism
* [x] The implementation will follow these steps:
  * [x] Store the last valid JWKSKeyLoader in the lastValidResult field
  * [x] If a new request fails but there's a valid cached result, return the cached result
  * [x] Log a warning when falling back to the cached result
  * [x] Only return an empty result if there's no valid cached result
