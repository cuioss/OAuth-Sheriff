= Refactoring Opportunities for cui-jwt-token-handling

This document outlines potential refactoring opportunities for the cui-jwt-token-handling project. Each task is actionable and includes a rationale.

== Task Completion Process

After implementing any task in this document, follow these steps:

1. Clean-Up Code: Use "./mvnw -Prewrite-prepare-release rewrite:run" -> verify with "./mvnw clean install" -> Fix if necessary and commit
2. Clean-Up Javadoc: "./mvnw clean install -Pjavadoc" -> Fix all errors and warnings, verify until they are all corrected
3. Verify the documentation is updated correctly
4. Commit the changes with a git commit. Use the task name (e.g., "C1. Document Bouncy Castle Usage") as the commit message
5. Check the checkbox for the completed task

== Task List

Each task is numbered with a prefix indicating its category (e.g., "implement task C4" for code-specific task 4).

== Code Structure and Design

== Performance Improvements

== Security Enhancements

=== S1. Implement Key Rotation Alerts
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Add monitoring and alerting for key rotation events to ensure timely response to key changes.

*Rationale:* Proactive monitoring of key rotation helps prevent authentication failures during key transitions.

=== S2. Add Support for Additional Cryptographic Algorithms
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Extend AlgorithmPreferences to support additional modern cryptographic algorithms as they become standardized.

*Rationale:* Staying current with cryptographic standards is essential for long-term security.

== Testing Improvements

=== T2. Complete CUI-JWT-12.2: Unit Testing
[x] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Enhance unit test coverage to meet the minimum requirement of 80% code coverage.
Standards, see:

 * https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/blob/main/standards/testing/core-standards.adoc
* https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/blob/main/standards/testing/quality-standards.adoc

Focus on:

1. Edge cases for token parsing and validation
2. Error handling scenarios
3. Comprehensive testing of all public methods

*Rationale:* Comprehensive unit testing ensures the library functions correctly and helps prevent regressions.


=== T3. Implement CUI-JWT-7: Logging Tests
[x] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Implement comprehensive logging tests to verify that the JWT token handling library logs appropriate information at the correct log levels. This includes:

1. Testing logging of successful token validation
2. Testing logging of successful key retrieval
3. Testing logging of successful token creation
4. Testing logging of token validation failures
5. Testing logging of key retrieval failures
6. Testing logging of token creation failures

The tests should follow CUI logging test requirements using `cui-test-juli-logger` and `de.cuioss.test.juli.TestLogLevel`.
Standards, see:

 * https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/blob/main/standards/logging/testing-guide.adoc

*Rationale:* Proper logging is essential for monitoring, debugging, and security auditing of the JWT token handling library.

== Dependency Management

== Documentation Improvements

=== DOC1. Create Comprehensive JavaDoc
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Ensure all public classes and methods have comprehensive JavaDoc comments, including examples where appropriate.
Standards, see:

* https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/blob/main/standards/documentation/general-standard.adoc
* https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/blob/main/standards/documentation/javadoc-standards.adoc

*Rationale:* Complete documentation improves usability and reduces the learning curve for new developers.

== Future Enhancements

=== F1. Support for JWT Token Issuance
[ ] *Priority:* Low

*Description:* Consider adding support for JWT token issuance in addition to validation.

*Rationale:* This would make the library more comprehensive and useful for a wider range of use cases.

=== F2. Add Support for OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect 2.0
[ ] *Priority:* Low

*Description:* Plan for supporting upcoming OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect 2.0 standards.

*Rationale:* Staying current with evolving standards ensures long-term relevance of the library.

=== F3. Implement Pluggable Validation Rules
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Create a pluggable system for custom validation rules to allow users to extend the validation pipeline.

*Rationale:* This would increase flexibility and allow for domain-specific validation requirements.

=== F4. Implement CUI-JWT-1.4: Token Decryption
[ ] *Priority:* Low

*Description:* Implement support for decryption of encrypted JWT tokens (JWE) as defined in RFC 7516. This includes:
1. Parser modifications to recognize and handle JWE tokens
2. Data model extensions to support JWE structure
3. Key management extensions for encryption keys
4. Security considerations for JWE tokens

*Rationale:* Supporting encrypted tokens would enhance the security of sensitive information in tokens and provide a more comprehensive JWT handling solution.
