= Refactoring Opportunities for cui-jwt-token-handling

This document outlines potential refactoring opportunities for the cui-jwt-token-handling project. Each task is actionable and includes a rationale.

== Task Completion Process

After implementing any task in this document, follow these steps:

1. Clean-Up Code: Use "./mvnw -Prewrite-prepare-release rewrite:run" -> verify with "./mvnw clean install" -> Fix if necessary and commit
2. Clean-Up Javadoc: "./mvnw clean install -Pjavadoc" -> Fix all errors and warnings, verify until they are all corrected
3. Verify the documentation is updated correctly
4. Commit the changes with a git commit. Use the task name (e.g., "C1. Document Bouncy Castle Usage") as the commit message
5. Check the checkbox for the completed task

== Task List

Each task is numbered with a prefix indicating its category (e.g., "implement task C4" for code-specific task 4).

== Code Structure and Design

=== C1. Optimize Builder Pattern Usage
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Avoid excessive usage of Builder-Pattern. Builder-pattern should only be used, if there are more than two parameters. Otherwise only use a constructor. Review all types and refactor accordingly. If both are present ensure, that either it is builder-only, by making the constructor private. Or remove the builder, if there are less than three parameters.

*Rationale:* Optimizing the use of the Builder pattern improves code readability and maintainability by using the appropriate construction pattern based on the complexity of the object creation.


== Performance Improvements

== Security Enhancements

=== S1. Implement Key Rotation Alerts
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Add monitoring and alerting for key rotation events to ensure timely response to key changes.

*Rationale:* Proactive monitoring of key rotation helps prevent authentication failures during key transitions.

=== S2. Add Support for Additional Cryptographic Algorithms
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Extend AlgorithmPreferences to support additional modern cryptographic algorithms as they become standardized.

*Rationale:* Staying current with cryptographic standards is essential for long-term security.

=== S3. Incorporate SecurityEventCounter into JwksLoader
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Find a way to incorporate SecurityEventCounter into JwksLoader, particularly at object construction time. Currently, TokenFactory is the holder of SecurityEventCounter, but JwksLoader needs access to it to report JWKS-related security events. One approach could be modifying JwksLoaderFactory.createHttpLoader() to accept a SecurityEventCounter parameter (e.g., createHttpLoader(@NonNull HttpJwksLoaderConfig config, @NonNull SecurityEventCounter securityEventCounter)). The challenge is that TokenFactory creates the SecurityEventCounter but doesn't directly create the JwksLoader - this happens in IssuerConfig. Potential solutions might involve:

1. Modifying IssuerConfig to accept and pass through a SecurityEventCounter
2. Creating a callback mechanism where JwksLoader can request the SecurityEventCounter when needed
3. Using a dependency injection approach to provide the SecurityEventCounter
4. Implementing a factory method in TokenFactory that creates properly configured JwksLoader instances

*Rationale:* Incorporating SecurityEventCounter into JwksLoader would allow for more comprehensive security event tracking, particularly for JWKS-related events like fetch failures, JSON parsing errors, and key not found situations. This would improve security monitoring and auditing capabilities.


== Testing Improvements


== Dependency Management

=== D1. Update to Latest Stable Dependencies
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

*Rationale:* Keeping dependencies current reduces security vulnerabilities and ensures access to the latest features.

=== D2. Minimize Runtime Dependencies
[ ] *Priority:* Low

*Description:* Review dependencies and mark appropriate libraries as optional or provided scope to reduce the deployment footprint.

*Rationale:* Minimizing runtime dependencies reduces potential conflicts and improves deployment flexibility.

== Documentation Improvements

=== DOC1. Create Comprehensive JavaDoc
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Ensure all public classes and methods have comprehensive JavaDoc comments, including examples where appropriate.

*Rationale:* Complete documentation improves usability and reduces the learning curve for new developers.

== Future Enhancements

=== F1. Support for JWT Token Issuance
[ ] *Priority:* Low

*Description:* Consider adding support for JWT token issuance in addition to validation.

*Rationale:* This would make the library more comprehensive and useful for a wider range of use cases.

=== F2. Add Support for OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect 2.0
[ ] *Priority:* Low

*Description:* Plan for supporting upcoming OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect 2.0 standards.

*Rationale:* Staying current with evolving standards ensures long-term relevance of the library.

=== F3. Implement Pluggable Validation Rules
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Create a pluggable system for custom validation rules to allow users to extend the validation pipeline.

*Rationale:* This would increase flexibility and allow for domain-specific validation requirements.

=== S4. Implement CUI-JWT-7.3: Security Events
[x] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Introduce a new parameter object that provides counters for relevant security events. It should be structured for counting only and not duplicate logging. The counter should be kept within TokenFactory and accessible from outside via an API. It should be passed to each relevant flow element to report corresponding events. The counter must provide a reset method and be implemented in a highly concurrent way. All unit tests must verify the corresponding event counts. Use the same numbering/naming scheme as in JWTTokenLogMessages. The implementation should be structured to simplify later integration with micrometer but should not create any dependency on it at this time.
After implementing, ensure all relevant specifications are updated accordingly.

*Rationale:* Tracking security events provides valuable metrics for monitoring and auditing the system's security posture, enabling better detection of potential security issues and anomalies.
