= Refactoring Opportunities for cui-jwt-token-handling

This document outlines potential refactoring opportunities for the cui-jwt-token-handling project. Each task is actionable and includes a rationale.

== Code Structure and Design

=== 1. Document Bouncy Castle Usage
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Ensure that the usage of Bouncy Castle for cryptographic operations is consistently documented throughout the codebase and documentation.
*Rationale:* Clear documentation of cryptographic dependencies is important for security reviews and understanding the library's security model.

=== 2. Extract Interface for TokenFactory
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Create an interface for TokenFactory to improve testability and allow for alternative implementations.
*Rationale:* Following the interface segregation principle would make the code more modular and easier to test with mocks.

=== 3. Implement Builder Pattern Consistently
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Ensure all complex objects use the builder pattern consistently. Some classes already use Lombok's @Builder annotation, but this pattern could be extended to other classes.
*Rationale:* Consistent use of the builder pattern improves code readability and maintainability.

== Performance Improvements

=== 1. Optimize Token Validation Pipeline
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Review the token validation pipeline for potential performance optimizations, particularly for high-throughput scenarios.
*Rationale:* The current pipeline approach is well-structured but might benefit from optimizations like early termination for common failure cases.

=== 2. Enhance Caching Strategy
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Review and potentially enhance the caching strategy for JWKS keys to reduce network calls and improve performance.
*Rationale:* Efficient caching is critical for performance in multi-issuer environments.

== Security Enhancements

=== 1. Implement Key Rotation Alerts
*Priority:* High
*Description:* Add monitoring and alerting for key rotation events to ensure timely response to key changes.
*Rationale:* Proactive monitoring of key rotation helps prevent authentication failures during key transitions.

=== 2. Add Support for Additional Cryptographic Algorithms
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Extend AlgorithmPreferences to support additional modern cryptographic algorithms as they become standardized.
*Rationale:* Staying current with cryptographic standards is essential for long-term security.

=== 3. Implement Rate Limiting for Token Validation
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Add rate limiting capabilities to prevent denial-of-service attacks through excessive token validation requests.
*Rationale:* Rate limiting is a standard security practice to prevent resource exhaustion.

== Testing Improvements

=== 1. Increase Test Coverage for Edge Cases
*Priority:* High
*Description:* Add more tests for edge cases, particularly around token expiration, clock skew, and network failures.
*Rationale:* Comprehensive testing of edge cases improves reliability in production environments.

=== 2. Add Performance Benchmarks
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Implement performance benchmarks to measure and track token validation performance over time.
*Rationale:* Performance benchmarks help identify regressions and validate optimizations.

=== 3. Enhance Integration Testing
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Expand integration tests with additional identity providers beyond Keycloak.
*Rationale:* Testing with multiple providers ensures compatibility in diverse environments.

== Dependency Management

=== 1. Update to Latest Stable Dependencies
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*Rationale:* Keeping dependencies current reduces security vulnerabilities and ensures access to the latest features.

=== 2. Minimize Runtime Dependencies
*Priority:* Low
*Description:* Review dependencies and mark appropriate libraries as optional or provided scope to reduce the deployment footprint.
*Rationale:* Minimizing runtime dependencies reduces potential conflicts and improves deployment flexibility.

== Documentation Improvements

=== 1. Create Comprehensive JavaDoc
*Priority:* High
*Description:* Ensure all public classes and methods have comprehensive JavaDoc comments, including examples where appropriate.
*Rationale:* Complete documentation improves usability and reduces the learning curve for new developers.

=== 2. Add Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Document key architectural decisions, particularly around security choices and multi-issuer support.
*Rationale:* ADRs provide context for future maintainers and help preserve institutional knowledge.

=== 3. Create Usage Examples
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Develop additional usage examples for common scenarios, particularly for multi-issuer environments.
*Rationale:* Examples help users understand how to effectively use the library in real-world situations.

== Future Enhancements

=== 1. Support for JWT Token Issuance
*Priority:* Low
*Description:* Consider adding support for JWT token issuance in addition to validation.
*Rationale:* This would make the library more comprehensive and useful for a wider range of use cases.

=== 2. Add Support for OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect 2.0
*Priority:* Low
*Description:* Plan for supporting upcoming OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect 2.0 standards.
*Rationale:* Staying current with evolving standards ensures long-term relevance of the library.

=== 3. Implement Pluggable Validation Rules
*Priority:* Medium
*Description:* Create a pluggable system for custom validation rules to allow users to extend the validation pipeline.
*Rationale:* This would increase flexibility and allow for domain-specific validation requirements.
