= Refactoring Opportunities for cui-jwt-token-handling

This document outlines potential refactoring opportunities for the cui-jwt-token-handling project. Each task is actionable and includes a rationale.

== Task Completion Process

After implementing any task in this document, follow these steps:

1. Clean-Up Code: Use "./mvnw -Prewrite-prepare-release rewrite:run" -> verify with "./mvnw clean install" -> Fix if necessary and commit
2. Clean-Up Javadoc: "./mvnw clean install -Pjavadoc" -> Fix all errors and warnings, verify until they are all corrected
3. Verify the documentation is updated correctly
4. Commit the changes with a git commit. Use the task name (e.g., "C1. Document Bouncy Castle Usage") as the commit message
5. Check the checkbox for the completed task

== Task List

Each task is numbered with a prefix indicating its category (e.g., "implement task C4" for code-specific task 4).

== Code Structure and Design

=== C3. Implement Builder Pattern Consistently
[x] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Ensure all complex objects use the builder pattern consistently. Some classes already use Lombok's @Builder annotation, but this pattern could be extended to other classes.

*Rationale:* Consistent use of the builder pattern improves code readability and maintainability.

== Performance Improvements

=== P1. Optimize Token Validation Pipeline
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Review the token validation pipeline for potential performance optimizations, particularly for high-throughput scenarios.

*Rationale:* The current pipeline approach is well-structured but might benefit from optimizations like early termination for common failure cases.

=== P2. Enhance Caching Strategy
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Review and potentially enhance the caching strategy for JWKS keys to reduce network calls and improve performance.

*Rationale:* Efficient caching is critical for performance in multi-issuer environments.

== Security Enhancements

=== S1. Implement Key Rotation Alerts
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Add monitoring and alerting for key rotation events to ensure timely response to key changes.

*Rationale:* Proactive monitoring of key rotation helps prevent authentication failures during key transitions.

=== S2. Add Support for Additional Cryptographic Algorithms
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Extend AlgorithmPreferences to support additional modern cryptographic algorithms as they become standardized.

*Rationale:* Staying current with cryptographic standards is essential for long-term security.

=== S3. Implement Rate Limiting for Token Validation
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Add rate limiting capabilities to prevent denial-of-service attacks through excessive token validation requests.

*Rationale:* Rate limiting is a standard security practice to prevent resource exhaustion.

== Testing Improvements


=== T2. Add Performance Benchmarks
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Implement performance benchmarks to measure and track token validation performance over time. Use de.cuioss.jwt.token.test.util.PerformanceStatistics therfore. see de.cuioss.jwt.token.jwks.HttpJwksLoaderPerformanceTest for usage example

*Rationale:* Performance benchmarks help identify regressions and validate optimizations.

=== T3. Enhance Integration Testing
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Expand integration tests with additional identity providers beyond Keycloak.

*Rationale:* Testing with multiple providers ensures compatibility in diverse environments.

=== T4. Analyze for duplicate unit-test
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Analyze all unit-test for duplicate tests. For each found merge them. But this must never result in a decrease of coverage.

*Rationale:* Eliminating duplicate tests improves maintainability and reduces test execution time while ensuring the same level of quality assurance.

=== T5. Unit-Test: Incorporate Generators
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Incorporate Generators where sensible. de.cuioss.jwt.token.test.generator provides a number of domain specific generators. Use de.cuioss.test.generator.Generators for other types. Annotate each unit-test using a generator with @EnableGeneratorController for enabling later reproducibility.

*Rationale:* Using generators improves test quality by providing a wider range of test data and makes tests more maintainable and reproducible.

== Dependency Management

=== D1. Update to Latest Stable Dependencies
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

*Rationale:* Keeping dependencies current reduces security vulnerabilities and ensures access to the latest features.

=== D2. Minimize Runtime Dependencies
[ ] *Priority:* Low

*Description:* Review dependencies and mark appropriate libraries as optional or provided scope to reduce the deployment footprint.

*Rationale:* Minimizing runtime dependencies reduces potential conflicts and improves deployment flexibility.

== Documentation Improvements

=== DOC1. Create Comprehensive JavaDoc
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Ensure all public classes and methods have comprehensive JavaDoc comments, including examples where appropriate.

*Rationale:* Complete documentation improves usability and reduces the learning curve for new developers.

=== DOC2. Add Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Document key architectural decisions, particularly around security choices and multi-issuer support.

*Rationale:* ADRs provide context for future maintainers and help preserve institutional knowledge.

=== DOC3. Create Usage Examples
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Develop additional usage examples for common scenarios, particularly for multi-issuer environments.

*Rationale:* Examples help users understand how to effectively use the library in real-world situations.

== Future Enhancements

=== F1. Support for JWT Token Issuance
[ ] *Priority:* Low

*Description:* Consider adding support for JWT token issuance in addition to validation.

*Rationale:* This would make the library more comprehensive and useful for a wider range of use cases.

=== F2. Add Support for OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect 2.0
[ ] *Priority:* Low

*Description:* Plan for supporting upcoming OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect 2.0 standards.

*Rationale:* Staying current with evolving standards ensures long-term relevance of the library.

=== F3. Implement Pluggable Validation Rules
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Create a pluggable system for custom validation rules to allow users to extend the validation pipeline.

*Rationale:* This would increase flexibility and allow for domain-specific validation requirements.

=== S4. Implement CUI-JWT-7.3: Security Events
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Introduce a new parameter object that provides counters for relevant security events. It should be structured for counting only and not duplicate logging. The counter should be kept within TokenFactory and accessible from outside via an API. It should be passed to each relevant flow element to report corresponding events. The counter must provide a reset method and be implemented in a highly concurrent way. All unit tests must verify the corresponding event counts. Use the same numbering/naming scheme as in JWTTokenLogMessages. The implementation should be structured to simplify later integration with micrometer but should not create any dependency on it at this time.

*Rationale:* Tracking security events provides valuable metrics for monitoring and auditing the system's security posture, enabling better detection of potential security issues and anomalies.
