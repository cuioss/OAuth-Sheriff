== Overview
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-12[CUI-JWT-12: Testing and Quality Assurance]_

This document provides detailed specifications for testing the JWT token handling library.

== Compliance with CUI Testing Standards

This section outlines how the JWT token handling library testing should comply with the CUI Testing Standards:

* https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/blob/main/standards/testing/core-standards.adoc[CUI Testing Core Standards]
* https://github.com/cuioss/cui-llm-rules/blob/main/standards/testing/quality-standards.adoc[CUI Quality Standards and Testing Framework]

=== Summary of CUI Testing Core Standards

The CUI Testing Core Standards define the following key principles:

==== Core Testing Principles
* *Test Coverage*: All public methods must have unit tests, with at least 80% line coverage
* *Test Independence*: Tests must be independent, not rely on execution order, and clean up after themselves
* *Test Clarity*: Tests should follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and clearly describe what is being tested
* *Test Maintenance*: Tests must be maintained alongside production code and fixed promptly when failing

==== Test Types
* *Unit Tests*: Focus on testing a single unit of code in isolation with mocked dependencies
* *Integration Tests*: Test interaction between components, may use real dependencies
* *System Tests*: Test the entire system as a whole, verifying end-to-end functionality

==== Best Practices
* *Test Organization*: Group related tests, use descriptive names, follow consistent conventions
* *Test Data*: Use meaningful test data, avoid hardcoded values, consider edge cases
* *Assertions*: Use specific assertions with meaningful error messages

=== Summary of CUI Quality Standards and Testing Framework

The CUI Quality Standards and Testing Framework defines:

==== Core Testing Standards
* *Test Structure*: Follow AAA pattern, one logical assertion per test, clear naming
* *Coverage Requirements*: Minimum 80% line and branch coverage, critical paths must have 100% coverage
* *Testing Tools*: Use JUnit 5, CUI testing utilities (cui-test-generator, cui-test-value-objects, etc.)

==== Quality Verification
* *Quality Analysis Tools*: SonarCloud, JUnit, mutation testing, code reviews
* *Quality Metrics*: Code coverage, duplication, complexity, issue density, technical debt
* *Parameterized Tests Best Practices*: Minimum 3 test cases, descriptive method names, clear documentation
* *Performance*: Fast test execution, efficient resource usage, parallel execution where possible
* *Review Process*: Regular reviews after major features, before PRs, during code review

==== Success Criteria
* *Test Coverage*: All coverage requirements met, critical paths fully covered
* *Quality Analysis*: All quality gates passed, new issues addressed
* *Security*: No critical vulnerabilities, security hotspots reviewed


== Testing Strategy

=== Unit Testing
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-12.2[CUI-JWT-12.2: Unit Testing]_

==== Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

Unit tests have been implemented for the core functionality, but additional tests are needed for comprehensive coverage.

The following test classes implement these unit tests:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/TokenFactoryTest.java[TokenFactoryTest.java] - Tests for the TokenFactory
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/TokenTypeTest.java[TokenTypeTest.java] - Tests for token type enumeration
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/domain/token/BaseTokenContentTest.java[BaseTokenContentTest.java] - Tests for the base token content
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/domain/token/AccessTokenContentTest.java[AccessTokenContentTest.java] - Tests for access token content
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/domain/token/IdTokenContentTest.java[IdTokenContentTest.java] - Tests for ID token content

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/CustomClaimMapperTest.java[CustomClaimMapperTest.java] - Tests for custom claim mapping

These tests cover:

1. Token parsing and validation
2. Key management and rotation
3. Multi-issuer support
4. Basic error handling
5. Some edge cases (malformed tokens, expired tokens, etc.)

==== Test Cases

The following test cases will be implemented:

1. **Token Parsing Tests**:
   * Parse valid token
   * Parse token with invalid signature
   * Parse expired token
   * Parse token with missing claims
   * Parse token with unsupported algorithm

2. **Key Management Tests**:
   * Retrieve key by ID
   * Refresh keys
   * Handle key rotation
   * Handle key retrieval failures

3. **Multi-Issuer Tests**:
   * Parse tokens from different issuers
   * Handle unknown issuers
   * Select correct parser based on issuer

4. **Error Handling Tests**:
   * Handle malformed tokens
   * Handle network failures
   * Handle invalid keys

==== Example Test

[source,java]
----
@Test
void shouldParseValidToken() {
    // Given
    String token = createValidToken();

    // When
    Optional<ParsedToken> result = tokenFactory.createToken(token);

    // Then
    assertTrue(result.isPresent());
    assertEquals("test-subject", result.get().getSubject());
    assertEquals("test-issuer", result.get().getIssuer());
}

@Test
void shouldReturnEmptyForInvalidSignature() {
    // Given
    String token = createTokenWithInvalidSignature();

    // When
    Optional<ParsedToken> result = tokenFactory.createToken(token);

    // Then
    assertFalse(result.isPresent());
}
----

=== Integration Testing with TestContainers
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-12.3[CUI-JWT-12.3: Integration Testing]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

Integration tests have been implemented to verify compatibility with Keycloak as an identity provider (IDP) using TestContainers.

The following test class implements integration tests with Keycloak:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/TokenKeycloakITTest.java[TokenKeycloakITTest.java] - Integration tests with Keycloak

These tests cover:

* Parsing access tokens from Keycloak
* Parsing ID tokens from Keycloak
* Parsing refresh tokens from Keycloak
* Validating tokens against Keycloak JWKS endpoint
* Handling token expiration and validation

The implementation uses:

* Official Keycloak TestContainer: https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/keycloak/
* CUI Keycloak Integration: `de.cuioss.test:cui-test-keycloak-integration` (Maven dependency)

The `KeycloakITBase` class from the `cui-test-keycloak-integration` library provides automatic setup and teardown of a Keycloak container, methods to get the Keycloak URLs, test realm and user configuration, and helper methods for token requests and validation.

Refer to the implementation and associated JavaDoc for detailed behavior.

=== Security Testing
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8[CUI-JWT-8: Security]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

Comprehensive security testing has been implemented to verify the security aspects of the JWT token handling library.

The following test classes implement these security tests:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/ClientConfusionAttackTest.java[ClientConfusionAttackTest.java] - Tests for client confusion attacks
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/TokenFactorySecurityEventTest.java[TokenFactorySecurityEventTest.java] - Tests for security event tracking

These tests cover:

1. Token validation bypass tests
2. Algorithm confusion attack tests
3. Signature verification bypass tests
4. Security event tracking and monitoring


=== Performance Testing
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-12.4[CUI-JWT-12.4: Performance Testing]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

Performance testing has been implemented to verify that the JWT token handling library meets the performance requirements.

The following test class implements performance testing:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/TokenFactoryPerformanceTest.java[TokenFactoryPerformanceTest.java] - Tests for token parsing and validation performance

These tests cover:

1. Token parsing performance for different token types
2. Concurrent token validation performance
3. Mixed token type processing performance
4. Performance statistics collection and analysis

The implementation uses concurrent testing to simulate real-world load scenarios and measures:

1. Throughput (tokens processed per second)
2. Average processing time per token
3. Success rate under load
4. Performance under different concurrency levels

=== Logging Tests
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-7[CUI-JWT-7: Logging]_

==== Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

Comprehensive logging tests need to be implemented to verify that the JWT token handling library logs appropriate information at the correct log levels.

The logging tests will follow CUI logging test requirements:

1. Use `cui-test-juli-logger` for testing
2. Use `de.cuioss.test.juli.TestLogLevel` for log levels
3. Test coverage required for INFO/WARN/ERROR/FATAL logs
4. Follow LogAsserts guidelines:
   * First argument must be TestLogLevel
   * Only assertNoLogMessagePresent needs Logger parameter
   * Use appropriate assertion methods:
     * assertLogMessagePresent: Exact match
     * assertLogMessagePresentContaining: Partial match
     * assertNoLogMessagePresent: Absence check
     * assertSingleLogMessagePresent: Single occurrence
5. Test both successful and error scenarios
6. Use LogRecord#resolveIdentifierString for message verification

==== Planned Test Cases

The following test cases are planned for implementation:

1. **Success Scenario Logging Tests**:
   * Test logging of successful token validation
   * Test logging of successful key retrieval
   * Test logging of successful token creation

2. **Error Scenario Logging Tests**:
   * Test logging of token validation failures
   * Test logging of key retrieval failures
   * Test logging of token creation failures

These tests will ensure that the library logs appropriate information at the correct log levels for both successful operations and error scenarios.

=== Vulnerability Scanning
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-12.5[CUI-JWT-12.5: Vulnerability Scanning]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

Vulnerability scanning has been implemented using GitHub Dependabot, which is configured to scan Maven dependencies weekly and create pull requests for updates. This ensures that the library is regularly checked for security vulnerabilities in its dependencies.

The Dependabot configuration can be found in `.github/dependabot.yml` and includes:

* Weekly scanning of Maven dependencies
* Automatic creation of pull requests for security updates
* Notifications for security vulnerabilities

This implementation satisfies the requirement for regular vulnerability scanning of third-party dependencies as specified in CUI-JWT-12.5.

=== Compliance Testing
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-12.6[CUI-JWT-12.6: Compliance Testing]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

Compliance tests have been implemented to verify that the JWT token handling library adheres to the standards and best practices defined in various specifications.

The following test classes implement these compliance tests:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/RFC7519JWTComplianceTest.java[RFC7519JWTComplianceTest.java] - Tests compliance with the JWT specification defined in RFC 7519
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/OpenIDConnectComplianceTest.java[OpenIDConnectComplianceTest.java] - Tests compliance with OpenID Connect Certification requirements
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/OAuth2JWTBestPracticesComplianceTest.java[OAuth2JWTBestPracticesComplianceTest.java] - Tests compliance with OAuth 2.0 JWT Best Current Practices

These tests cover:

1. **RFC 7519 JWT Compliance**:
   * JWT format and structure validation
   * Registered claim names handling
   * Token validation rules
   * JWT claims set processing

2. **OpenID Connect Compliance**:
   * ID Token required and optional claims
   * Standard claims handling
   * Token validation according to OpenID Connect Core 1.0

3. **OAuth 2.0 JWT Best Practices Compliance**:
   * Audience validation
   * Issuer validation
   * Signature validation
   * Token lifetime validation
   * Token size limits

==== Test Class Naming Convention

Compliance test classes will follow this naming pattern:

`<Standard><Feature>ComplianceTest`

Where:
* `<Standard>` is the identifier of the standard or specification (e.g., RFC7519, OAuth2)
* `<Feature>` is the specific feature or aspect being tested (e.g., JWT, TokenValidation)

==== Requirement Referencing

Within each compliance test class, tests will include references to the specific requirements they verify through:

1. Class-level documentation that lists all requirements covered by the test class
2. Method-level documentation that specifies which requirement(s) each test method verifies
3. Assertions that include requirement identifiers in failure messages

This approach will ensure that:

1. Test classes are consistently named based on the standards they verify
2. Each test is clearly linked to the requirements it validates
3. It's easy to trace from requirements to tests and vice versa
4. Test failure messages provide context about which requirements are violated
