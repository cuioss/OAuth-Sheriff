== Overview
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8[CUI-JWT-8: Security] and link:../Threat-Model.adoc[Threat Model]_

This document provides detailed specifications for the security aspects of the JWT token handling library.

== Security Measures

=== Signature Validation
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-1.3[CUI-JWT-1.3: Signature Validation]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/TokenValidator.java[TokenValidator]

The following tests verify the implementation:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenSignatureValidatorTest.java[TokenSignatureValidatorTest] - Comprehensive tests for signature validation, including:
** Validation of tokens with supported algorithms (RS256)
** Rejection of tokens with unsupported algorithms (HS256, HS384, HS512, none)
** Protection against algorithm confusion attacks
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/TokenValidatorTest.java[TokenValidatorTest] - Tests for the TokenValidator class

The library supports the following signature algorithms as specified in the requirements:

==== Supported Algorithms

* RS256 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256)
* RS384 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-384)
* RS512 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512)
* PS256 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256)
* PS384 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-384 and MGF1 with SHA-384)
* PS512 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-512 and MGF1 with SHA-512)
* ES256 (ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256)
* ES384 (ECDSA using P-384 and SHA-384)
* ES512 (ECDSA using P-521 and SHA-512)

==== Rejected Algorithms

The following algorithms are explicitly rejected for security reasons:

* HS256 (HMAC using SHA-256)
* HS384 (HMAC using SHA-384)
* HS512 (HMAC using SHA-512)
* None (Unsecured JWT)

Refer to the implementation and associated JavaDoc for detailed behavior.

=== Token Size Limits
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.1[CUI-JWT-8.1: Token Size Limits]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/NonValidatingJwtParser.java[NonValidatingJwtParser]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/TokenValidator.java[TokenValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/ParserConfig.java[ParserConfig]

To prevent denial of service attacks, the library enforces a maximum token size of 8KB.

Token size is checked before parsing and tokens larger than the configured limit are rejected. The default limit is set to 8KB as recommended by OAuth 2.0 JWT BCP Section 3.11.

The ParserConfig class allows customizing token size limits:

[source,java]
----
TokenValidator validator = new TokenValidator(
    ParserConfig.builder()
        .maxTokenSize(8 * 1024)  // 8KB
        .maxPayloadSize(4 * 1024)  // 4KB
        .build(),
    issuerConfigs);
----

Refer to the implementation and associated JavaDoc for detailed behavior.

=== Safe Parsing
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.2[CUI-JWT-8.2: Safe Parsing]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/NonValidatingJwtParser.java[NonValidatingJwtParser]

The `NonValidatingJwtParser` class provides comprehensive safe parsing features to protect against common attacks such as memory exhaustion, stack overflow, and malformed input attacks.

For implementation details, see the JavaDoc of the link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/NonValidatingJwtParser.java[NonValidatingJwtParser] class.

The following tests verify the implementation:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/NonValidatingJwtParserTest.java[NonValidatingJwtParserTest] - Comprehensive tests for the NonValidatingJwtParser class, including:
** Token size validation tests
** JSON depth limit tests
** Large JSON array handling tests
** Large JSON string handling tests
** JsonReaderFactory caching tests

These security measures protect against common attacks such as memory exhaustion, stack overflow, and malformed input attacks.

=== Claims Validation
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.4[CUI-JWT-8.4: Claims Validation]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenClaimValidator.java[TokenClaimValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenHeaderValidator.java[TokenHeaderValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/IssuerConfig.java[IssuerConfig]

The library provides comprehensive validation for standard JWT claims as defined in RFC 7519.

==== Required Claims

* Issuer (iss) - validated by TokenHeaderValidator
* Subject (sub) - validated by TokenClaimValidator
* Expiration Time (exp) - validated by TokenClaimValidator
* Issued At (iat) - validated by TokenClaimValidator
* Not Before (nbf) - validated by TokenClaimValidator if present
* Audience (aud) - validated by TokenClaimValidator if expected audience is provided
* Authorized Party (azp) - validated by TokenClaimValidator if expected client ID is provided

For implementation details, see the JavaDoc of the link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenClaimValidator.java[TokenClaimValidator] and link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenHeaderValidator.java[TokenHeaderValidator] classes.

=== Secure Communication
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.3[CUI-JWT-8.3: Secure Communication]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/jwks/http/HttpJwksLoader.java[HttpJwksLoader]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/SecureSSLContextProvider.java[SecureSSLContextProvider]

The library ensures secure communication for key retrieval by requiring TLS 1.2 or higher by default. The `SecureSSLContextProvider` class is an instance class that allows configuration of the minimum TLS version to be used. The `HttpJwksLoader` uses a builder pattern for creation, with the `SecureSSLContextProvider` instance as an optional parameter.

For implementation details, see the JavaDoc of the link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/jwks/http/HttpJwksLoader.java[HttpJwksLoader] and link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/SecureSSLContextProvider.java[SecureSSLContextProvider] classes.

Integration tests verify the implementation by connecting to a Keycloak server using HTTPS.

=== Cryptographic Agility
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.5[CUI-JWT-8.5: Cryptographic Agility]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/AlgorithmPreferences.java[AlgorithmPreferences]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/JwkKeyHandler.java[JwkKeyHandler]

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/jwks/key/JWKSKeyLoader.java[JWKSKeyLoader]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/IssuerConfig.java[IssuerConfig]

The cryptographic agility features include:

1. Support for multiple signature algorithms (RSA, ECDSA, RSA-PSS)
2. Configuration of preferred algorithms through IssuerConfig
3. Key rotation and algorithm migration capabilities
4. Storage of algorithm information with keys
5. Selection of keys based on algorithm preferences
6. Isolation of low-level cryptographic operations in a dedicated handler class

For implementation details, see the JavaDoc of the following classes:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/AlgorithmPreferences.java[AlgorithmPreferences]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/JwkKeyHandler.java[JwkKeyHandler]

=== Security Events Monitoring
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-7.3[CUI-JWT-7.3: Security Events]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/SecurityEventCounter.java[SecurityEventCounter]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/TokenValidator.java[TokenValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenBuilder.java[TokenBuilder]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenClaimValidator.java[TokenClaimValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenHeaderValidator.java[TokenHeaderValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/NonValidatingJwtParser.java[NonValidatingJwtParser]

The library provides a mechanism to monitor and count security events that occur during token processing. This allows applications to track potential security issues and anomalies without duplicating logging functionality.

==== Features

* Thread-safe counter implementation for high concurrency environments
* Consistent event naming scheme aligned with JWTTokenLogMessages
* Support for all relevant security events (token validation failures, signature issues, etc.)
* Reset capability for counters (both individual and all counters)
* Designed for future integration with metrics systems like Micrometer
* Fine-grained event tracking at each step of the token processing pipeline

==== Usage

The SecurityEventCounter is integrated with TokenValidator and accessible via a getter method. Applications can:

1. Retrieve the counter from TokenValidator using `getSecurityEventCounter()`
2. Get counts for specific event types using `getCount(EventType)`
3. Get a snapshot of all counters using `getCounters()`
4. Reset individual counters using `reset(EventType)`
5. Reset all counters using `reset()`

This allows applications to monitor security events and take appropriate actions based on the counts.

==== Integration with Flow Elements

The SecurityEventCounter is passed to all flow elements in the token processing pipeline:

* TokenBuilder - Counts events during token creation
* TokenClaimValidator - Counts claim validation failures (missing claims, audience mismatch, etc.)
* TokenHeaderValidator - Counts header validation failures (algorithm issues, issuer mismatch)
* TokenSignatureValidator - Counts signature validation failures (key not found, invalid signatures)
* NonValidatingJwtParser - Counts token parsing failures (format issues, size limits)

This provides a more granular view of security events, allowing for better monitoring and troubleshooting.

==== Event Types

The SecurityEventCounter.EventType enum defines all countable security events, including:

* Token format issues (empty tokens, size exceeded, decoding failures)
* Missing claims (required claims, recommended elements)
* Validation failures (token expired, future tokens, audience mismatch)
* Signature issues (validation failures, key not found)
* Algorithm issues (unsupported algorithms, rejected algorithms)
* JWKS issues (fetch failures, parse failures)
* Critical security issues (security breaches, violations)

==== Bidirectional Links to Log Messages

Each EventType has a bidirectional link to its corresponding log message in JWTTokenLogMessages. This is implemented through the `getLogRecord()` method, which returns the appropriate LogRecord based on the event type's ID.

This bidirectional linking ensures:

1. Consistent error reporting between logs and metrics
2. Easy correlation between security events and log messages
3. Centralized management of security event definitions
4. Simplified troubleshooting by mapping event counts to specific log messages

For example, the TOKEN_EXPIRED event type (ID: 134) is linked to JWTTokenLogMessages.WARN.TOKEN_EXPIRED, ensuring that the same message template and identifier are used for both logging and event counting.

The following tests verify the implementation:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/security/SecurityEventCounterTest.java[SecurityEventCounterTest] - Tests for the SecurityEventCounter class
* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/TokenValidatorSecurityEventTest.java[TokenValidatorSecurityEventTest] - Tests for the integration with TokenValidator

=== Bouncy Castle Usage
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.5[CUI-JWT-8.5: Cryptographic Agility]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The library uses Bouncy Castle (bcprov-jdk18on) version 1.80 for cryptographic operations. Bouncy Castle was chosen for its comprehensive support of cryptographic algorithms, consistent behavior across JVM implementations, and active maintenance.

==== Integration Points

The following classes directly use Bouncy Castle:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/jwks/key/JwkKeyHandler.java[JwkKeyHandler] - Uses Bouncy Castle for:
** Retrieving EC curve parameters via `ECNamedCurveTable`
** Supporting a wide range of elliptic curves (P-256, P-384, P-521)
** Converting between Bouncy Castle curve specifications and JCA specifications

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/validation/flow/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator] - Uses Bouncy Castle for:
** Signature verification of JWT tokens
** Supporting multiple signature algorithms:
*** RSA signatures (RS256, RS384, RS512)
*** ECDSA signatures (ES256, ES384, ES512)
*** RSA-PSS signatures (PS256, PS384, PS512)

==== Configuration

Bouncy Castle is configured as follows:

* The BouncyCastleProvider is registered as a security provider in the JVM
* Registration occurs in static initializer blocks to ensure availability
* The provider is only registered if not already present
* No custom configuration of the provider is performed

==== Security Considerations

Using Bouncy Castle provides several security benefits:

* Support for modern cryptographic algorithms
* Consistent implementation across different JVM versions
* Regular security updates through dependency management
* Comprehensive support for key formats and algorithms
* Protection against algorithm substitution attacks

For implementation details, see the JavaDoc of the classes that use Bouncy Castle.

== Additional OAuth/JWT Security Considerations

Based on research from https://blog.doyensec.com/2025/01/30/oauth-common-vulnerabilities.html[OAuth Common Vulnerabilities (Doyensec, 2025)], this section addresses additional security considerations for JWT token handling in OAuth/OIDC scenarios.

=== Client Confusion Attack Prevention
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.4[CUI-JWT-8.4: Claims Validation]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The client confusion attack occurs when a token issued for one client is used with a different client. This can lead to unauthorized access if the validation doesn't verify that the token was issued for the correct client.

==== Implementation

* The `TokenClaimValidator` class validates the `azp` (authorized party) claim, which identifies the client the token was issued for.
* The `IssuerConfig` class supports both audience (`aud`) and `azp` validation through configuration.
* Validation of both claims is configurable through the `IssuerConfig` builder:
  * `expectedAudience()` - sets the expected audience for validation
  * `expectedClientId()` - sets the expected client ID for `azp` claim validation
* For maximum security, both audience and client ID validation should be enabled.

[source,java]
----
// Configure HTTP-based JWKS loading
HttpJwksLoaderConfig httpConfig = HttpJwksLoaderConfig.builder()
    .jwksUrl("https://issuer.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json")
    .refreshIntervalSeconds(60)
    .build();

// Create an issuer configuration with audience and client ID validation
IssuerConfig issuerConfig = IssuerConfig.builder()
    .issuer("https://issuer.example.com")
    .expectedAudience("client-id")
    .expectedClientId("client-id")
    .httpJwksLoaderConfig(httpConfig)
    .build();

// Create the token validator
TokenValidator validator = new TokenValidator(issuerConfig);
----

==== Security Note

To provide comprehensive protection against client confusion attacks, applications should:

1. Always include the `azp` claim in tokens issued for a specific client
2. Configure token validators to require `azp` validation
3. Consider making audience validation mandatory for all client applications

==== Test Specifications

1. **AZP Claim Validation Test**:
   * Create tokens with various `azp` claim values
   * Test validation with matching and non-matching client IDs
   * Verify tokens with non-matching `azp` values are rejected

2. **Client Confusion Attack Test**:
   * Create a token for Client A
   * Attempt to use it with Client B's configuration
   * Verify the token is rejected due to `azp` claim mismatch

=== Scope Upgrade Attack Prevention
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.4[CUI-JWT-8.4: Claims Validation]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The scope upgrade attack occurs when an attacker attempts to add additional scopes during the token exchange process, potentially gaining unauthorized privileges.

==== Current Implementation

* The `ParsedAccessToken` class provides methods to verify token scopes through `getScopes()`, `providesScopes()`, and `determineMissingScopes()`.
* Scope validation is implemented at the application level, not as part of the token validation process.
* The final check whether the scopes are correct are to be in the client library.
