This document provides detailed specifications for the security aspects of the JWT token handling library.

== Security Measures

=== Signature Validation
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-1.3[CUI-JWT-1.3: Signature Validation]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/TokenFactory.java[TokenFactory]

The following tests verify the implementation:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/TokenSignatureValidatorTest.java[TokenSignatureValidatorTest] - Comprehensive tests for signature validation, including:
** Validation of tokens with supported algorithms (RS256)
** Rejection of tokens with unsupported algorithms (HS256, HS384, HS512, none)
** Protection against algorithm confusion attacks

The library supports the following signature algorithms as specified in the requirements:

==== Supported Algorithms

* RS256 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256)
* RS384 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-384)
* RS512 (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512)
* PS256 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-256 and MGF1 with SHA-256)
* PS384 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-384 and MGF1 with SHA-384)
* PS512 (RSASSA-PSS using SHA-512 and MGF1 with SHA-512)
* ES256 (ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256)
* ES384 (ECDSA using P-384 and SHA-384)
* ES512 (ECDSA using P-521 and SHA-512)

==== Rejected Algorithms

The following algorithms are explicitly rejected for security reasons:

* HS256 (HMAC using SHA-256)
* HS384 (HMAC using SHA-384)
* HS512 (HMAC using SHA-512)
* None (Unsecured JWT)

Refer to the implementation and associated JavaDoc for detailed behavior.

=== Token Size Limits
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.1[CUI-JWT-8.1: Token Size Limits]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/NonValidatingJwtParser.java[NonValidatingJwtParser]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/TokenFactory.java[TokenFactory]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/TokenFactoryConfig.java[TokenFactoryConfig]

To prevent denial of service attacks, the library enforces a maximum token size of 8KB.

Token size is checked before parsing and tokens larger than the configured limit are rejected. The default limit is set to 8KB as recommended by OAuth 2.0 JWT BCP Section 3.11.

The TokenFactoryConfig class allows customizing token size limits:

[source,java]
----
TokenFactory factory = TokenFactory.create(
    issuerConfigs,
    TokenFactoryConfig.builder()
        .maxTokenSize(8 * 1024)  // 8KB
        .maxPayloadSize(4 * 1024)  // 4KB
        .build());
----

Refer to the implementation and associated JavaDoc for detailed behavior.

=== Safe Parsing
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.2[CUI-JWT-8.2: Safe Parsing]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/NonValidatingJwtParser.java[NonValidatingJwtParser]

The `NonValidatingJwtParser` class provides comprehensive safe parsing features to protect against common attacks such as memory exhaustion, stack overflow, and malformed input attacks.

For implementation details, see the JavaDoc of the link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/NonValidatingJwtParser.java[NonValidatingJwtParser] class.

The following tests verify the implementation:

* link:../../src/test/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/NonValidatingJwtParserTest.java[NonValidatingJwtParserTest] - Comprehensive tests for the NonValidatingJwtParser class, including:
** Token size validation tests
** JSON depth limit tests
** Large JSON array handling tests
** Large JSON string handling tests
** JsonReaderFactory caching tests

These security measures protect against common attacks such as memory exhaustion, stack overflow, and malformed input attacks.

=== Claims Validation
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.4[CUI-JWT-8.4: Claims Validation]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/TokenClaimValidator.java[TokenClaimValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/TokenHeaderValidator.java[TokenHeaderValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/IssuerConfig.java[IssuerConfig]

The library provides comprehensive validation for standard JWT claims as defined in RFC 7519.

==== Required Claims

* Issuer (iss) - validated by TokenHeaderValidator
* Subject (sub) - validated by TokenClaimValidator
* Expiration Time (exp) - validated by TokenClaimValidator
* Issued At (iat) - validated by TokenClaimValidator
* Not Before (nbf) - validated by TokenClaimValidator if present
* Audience (aud) - validated by TokenClaimValidator if expected audience is provided
* Authorized Party (azp) - validated by TokenClaimValidator if expected client ID is provided

For implementation details, see the JavaDoc of the link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/TokenClaimValidator.java[TokenClaimValidator] and link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/TokenHeaderValidator.java[TokenHeaderValidator] classes.

=== Secure Communication
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.3[CUI-JWT-8.3: Secure Communication]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/jwks/HttpJwksLoader.java[HttpJwksLoader]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/security/SecureSSLContextProvider.java[SecureSSLContextProvider]

The library ensures secure communication for key retrieval by requiring TLS 1.2 or higher by default. The `SecureSSLContextProvider` class is an instance class that allows configuration of the minimum TLS version to be used. The `HttpJwksLoader` uses a builder pattern for creation, with the `SecureSSLContextProvider` instance as an optional parameter.

For implementation details, see the JavaDoc of the link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/jwks/HttpJwksLoader.java[HttpJwksLoader] and link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/security/SecureSSLContextProvider.java[SecureSSLContextProvider] classes.

Integration tests verify the implementation by connecting to a Keycloak server using HTTPS.

=== Cryptographic Agility
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.5[CUI-JWT-8.5: Cryptographic Agility]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The following classes implement this specification:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/security/AlgorithmPreferences.java[AlgorithmPreferences]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/security/JwkKeyHandler.java[JwkKeyHandler]

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/jwks/key/JWKSKeyLoader.java[JWKSKeyLoader]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/IssuerConfig.java[IssuerConfig]

The cryptographic agility features include:

1. Support for multiple signature algorithms (RSA, ECDSA, RSA-PSS)
2. Configuration of preferred algorithms through IssuerConfig
3. Key rotation and algorithm migration capabilities
4. Storage of algorithm information with keys
5. Selection of keys based on algorithm preferences
6. Isolation of low-level cryptographic operations in a dedicated handler class

For implementation details, see the JavaDoc of the following classes:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/security/AlgorithmPreferences.java[AlgorithmPreferences]
* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/security/JwkKeyHandler.java[JwkKeyHandler]

=== Bouncy Castle Usage
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.5[CUI-JWT-8.5: Cryptographic Agility]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The library uses Bouncy Castle (bcprov-jdk18on) version 1.80 for cryptographic operations. Bouncy Castle was chosen for its comprehensive support of cryptographic algorithms, consistent behavior across JVM implementations, and active maintenance.

==== Integration Points

The following classes directly use Bouncy Castle:

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/jwks/key/JwkKeyHandler.java[JwkKeyHandler] - Uses Bouncy Castle for:
** Retrieving EC curve parameters via `ECNamedCurveTable`
** Supporting a wide range of elliptic curves (P-256, P-384, P-521)
** Converting between Bouncy Castle curve specifications and JCA specifications

* link:../../src/main/java/de/cuioss/jwt/token/flow/TokenSignatureValidator.java[TokenSignatureValidator] - Uses Bouncy Castle for:
** Signature verification of JWT tokens
** Supporting multiple signature algorithms:
*** RSA signatures (RS256, RS384, RS512)
*** ECDSA signatures (ES256, ES384, ES512)
*** RSA-PSS signatures (PS256, PS384, PS512)

==== Configuration

Bouncy Castle is configured as follows:

* The BouncyCastleProvider is registered as a security provider in the JVM
* Registration occurs in static initializer blocks to ensure availability
* The provider is only registered if not already present
* No custom configuration of the provider is performed

==== Security Considerations

Using Bouncy Castle provides several security benefits:

* Support for modern cryptographic algorithms
* Consistent implementation across different JVM versions
* Regular security updates through dependency management
* Comprehensive support for key formats and algorithms
* Protection against algorithm substitution attacks

For implementation details, see the JavaDoc of the classes that use Bouncy Castle.

== Additional OAuth/JWT Security Considerations

Based on research from https://blog.doyensec.com/2025/01/30/oauth-common-vulnerabilities.html[OAuth Common Vulnerabilities (Doyensec, 2025)], this section addresses additional security considerations for JWT token handling in OAuth/OIDC scenarios.

=== Client Confusion Attack Prevention
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.4[CUI-JWT-8.4: Claims Validation]_

==== Status: IMPLEMENTED

The client confusion attack occurs when a token issued for one client is used with a different client. This can lead to unauthorized access if the validation doesn't verify that the token was issued for the correct client.

==== Implementation

* The `TokenClaimValidator` class validates the `azp` (authorized party) claim, which identifies the client the token was issued for.
* The `IssuerConfig` class supports both audience (`aud`) and `azp` validation through configuration.
* Validation of both claims is configurable through the `IssuerConfig` builder:
  * `expectedAudience()` - sets the expected audience for validation
  * `expectedClientId()` - sets the expected client ID for `azp` claim validation
* For maximum security, both audience and client ID validation should be enabled.

[source,java]
----
IssuerConfig issuerConfig = IssuerConfig.builder()
    .issuer("https://issuer.example.com")
    .expectedAudience("client-id")
    .expectedClientId("client-id")
    .jwksKeyLoader(jwksKeyLoader)
    .build();
----

==== Security Note

To provide comprehensive protection against client confusion attacks, applications should:

1. Always include the `azp` claim in tokens issued for a specific client
2. Configure token validators to require `azp` validation
3. Consider making audience validation mandatory for all client applications

==== Test Specifications

1. **AZP Claim Validation Test**:
   * Create tokens with various `azp` claim values
   * Test validation with matching and non-matching client IDs
   * Verify tokens with non-matching `azp` values are rejected

2. **Client Confusion Attack Test**:
   * Create a token for Client A
   * Attempt to use it with Client B's configuration
   * Verify the token is rejected due to `azp` claim mismatch

=== Scope Upgrade Attack Prevention
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.4[CUI-JWT-8.4: Claims Validation]_

==== Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

The scope upgrade attack occurs when an attacker attempts to add additional scopes during the token exchange process, potentially gaining unauthorized privileges.

==== Current Implementation

* The `ParsedAccessToken` class provides methods to verify token scopes through `getScopes()`, `providesScopes()`, and `determineMissingScopes()`.
* Scope validation is currently implemented at the application level, not as part of the token validation process.

==== Required Enhancements

* Add support for scope validation during token validation.
* Implement scope restriction to ensure tokens aren't used with more privileges than originally granted.
* Add configuration option to specify expected or allowed scopes.

==== Test Specifications

1. **Scope Validation Test**:
   * Create tokens with various scope values
   * Test validation with expected scope sets
   * Verify tokens with insufficient scopes are appropriately flagged

2. **Scope Upgrade Attack Test**:
   * Create a token with limited scopes
   * Attempt scope upgrade through token manipulation
   * Verify the token validation process rejects the attempt

=== Mutable Claims Attack Prevention
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8.4[CUI-JWT-8.4: Claims Validation]_

==== Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

The mutable claims attack exploits non-immutable user identification fields (like email) instead of using immutable identifiers (like subject).

==== Required Enhancements

* Add validation for subject (`sub`) claim as the primary user identifier.
* Add warnings when token processing relies on mutable claims for user identification.
* Implement API methods that encourage using immutable identifiers.

==== Test Specifications

1. **Immutable Claims Test**:
   * Create tokens with various claim combinations (subject, email)
   * Test validation with different claim patterns
   * Verify the library enforces subject claim usage for identification

2. **Mutable Claims Attack Test**:
   * Create a token with conflicting mutable and immutable claims
   * Verify the library prioritizes immutable claims
   * Test that immutable claim (subject) is required

=== CSRF Prevention Recommendations
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8[CUI-JWT-8: Security]_

==== Status: NOT APPLICABLE (LIBRARY SCOPE)

CSRF prevention in OAuth requires the use of the `state` parameter at the application/framework level. While this is outside the direct scope of a token handling library, the documentation should provide guidance.

==== Documentation Enhancements

* Add security best practices section to documentation
* Provide guidance on using the `state` parameter in OAuth flows
* Include sample code for CSRF protection in OAuth applications

=== Redirect Attack Prevention Recommendations
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8[CUI-JWT-8: Security]_

==== Status: NOT APPLICABLE (LIBRARY SCOPE)

Redirect attacks are based on manipulating the `redirect_uri` parameter during OAuth authorization. This is handled at the application/framework level.

==== Documentation Enhancements

* Add security best practices section to documentation
* Provide guidance on secure redirect URI validation
* Warn against common implementation errors:
  * Validating only the domain
  * Allowing subdomains/wildcards
  * Using partial path matching

=== Mobile OAuth Security Recommendations
_See Requirement link:../Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8[CUI-JWT-8: Security]_

==== Status: NOT APPLICABLE (LIBRARY SCOPE)

Mobile OAuth security concerns are specific to mobile applications and platforms.

==== Documentation Enhancements

* Add section on mobile OAuth security
* Recommend use of Authorization Code Flow with PKCE
* Provide guidance on securing custom URI schemes
* Discuss platform-specific verification mechanisms
