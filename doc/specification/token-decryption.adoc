==== Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

This document provides detailed specifications for the token decryption support in the JWT Token Validation library. Token decryption support is marked as optional for a future version in the requirements.

== JWE Token Structure

The current implementation supports JWS (JSON Web Signature) tokens but lacks support for JWE (JSON Web Encryption) tokens. JWE tokens have a different structure than JWS tokens, consisting of five parts instead of three:

1. JOSE Header (Base64URL-encoded)
2. JWE Encrypted Key (Base64URL-encoded)
3. JWE Initialization Vector (Base64URL-encoded)
4. JWE Ciphertext (Base64URL-encoded)
5. JWE Authentication Tag (Base64URL-encoded)

== Implementation Requirements

=== Parser Modifications

==== NonValidatingJwtParser Extensions

The `NonValidatingJwtParser` class needs to be extended to recognize and handle JWE tokens:

* Add detection logic to identify JWE vs JWS tokens (based on number of parts and header content)
* Implement JWE token parsing without decryption for inspection purposes
* Update size validation to account for JWE token structure

==== JweParser Interface

A new `JweParser` interface and implementation should be created for decrypting JWE tokens:

* Support required JWE encryption algorithms (A128CBC-HS256, A256CBC-HS512, etc.)
* Support required key management algorithms (RSA-OAEP, ECDH-ES, etc.)
* Implement content encryption key (CEK) decryption
* Implement payload decryption and authentication

=== Data Model Extensions

==== DecodedJwt Extensions

The `DecodedJwt` class needs to be extended to support JWE structure:

* Add fields for JWE-specific parts (encrypted key, initialization vector, ciphertext, authentication tag)
* Update constructors and methods to handle JWE tokens
* Add methods to access JWE-specific information

==== DecryptedJwt Class

A new `DecryptedJwt` class should be created to represent a decrypted JWE token:

* Include methods to access the decrypted payload
* Maintain the original encrypted parts for reference

=== Key Management Extensions

==== JwksLoader Extensions

The `JwksLoader` interface needs to be extended to support encryption keys:

* Add support for loading encryption keys from JWKS endpoints
* Implement key identification for encryption keys
* Add methods to retrieve appropriate keys for decryption

==== Key Resolution for Decryption

Implement key resolution for decryption:

* Support "kid" header parameter for key identification
* Support "alg" header parameter for algorithm selection
* Support "enc" header parameter for content encryption algorithm

=== Security Considerations

==== Secure Handling of Decryption Keys

Implement secure handling of decryption keys:

* Ensure private keys are properly protected
* Implement key rotation support for decryption keys

==== JWE-specific Security Requirements

Add validation for JWE-specific security requirements:

* Validate encryption algorithms against allowed list
* Implement proper authentication tag validation
* Add protection against padding oracle attacks

=== Testing Requirements

==== JWE Functionality Tests

Create comprehensive tests for JWE functionality:

* Test parsing of JWE tokens
* Test decryption of JWE tokens with various algorithms
* Test handling of malformed JWE tokens
* Test error cases and edge conditions

==== JWE Security Tests

Add security tests specific to JWE:

* Test against known vulnerabilities in JWE implementations
* Test algorithm downgrade protection
* Test key confusion attack prevention
