== Analysis of JWKS Content Size

=== Typical JWKS Content Structure

A JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) typically contains one or more JWK (JSON Web Key) objects. Each JWK object represents a cryptographic key and contains key-specific parameters. The size of a JWKS depends on:

1. The number of keys in the set
2. The type of keys (RSA, EC, etc.)
3. The key size (e.g., 2048-bit RSA, 4096-bit RSA, P-256 EC, etc.)

=== Size Estimates for Different Key Types

Based on analysis of the JWKS content generation in the project:

==== RSA Keys (2048-bit)

* Modulus (n): ~342 bytes (Base64URL encoded)
* Exponent (e): ~4 bytes (Base64URL encoded)
* JSON structure overhead: ~50 bytes
* *Total per key*: ~400 bytes

==== RSA Keys (4096-bit)

* Modulus (n): ~684 bytes (Base64URL encoded)
* Exponent (e): ~4 bytes (Base64URL encoded)
* JSON structure overhead: ~50 bytes
* *Total per key*: ~750 bytes

==== EC Keys (P-256)

* X and Y coordinates: ~86 bytes (Base64URL encoded)
* JSON structure overhead: ~70 bytes
* *Total per key*: ~160 bytes

==== EC Keys (P-384)

* X and Y coordinates: ~128 bytes (Base64URL encoded)
* JSON structure overhead: ~70 bytes
* *Total per key*: ~200 bytes

==== EC Keys (P-521)

* X and Y coordinates: ~176 bytes (Base64URL encoded)
* JSON structure overhead: ~70 bytes
* *Total per key*: ~250 bytes

=== Size Estimates for JWKS with Multiple Keys

==== Small JWKS (1-5 keys)

* 1-5 keys (mix of RSA and EC): ~0.5-3 KB

==== Medium JWKS (6-20 keys)

* 6-20 keys (mix of RSA and EC): ~3-15 KB

==== Large JWKS (21-100 keys)

* 21-100 keys (mix of RSA and EC): ~15-75 KB

==== Very Large JWKS (100+ keys)

* 100+ keys (mix of RSA and EC): 75+ KB

== Industry Standards and Practices

=== OAuth 2.0 JWT Best Current Practice (BCP)

The OAuth 2.0 JWT BCP document (draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bcp-09) recommends a maximum token size of 8KB for JWT tokens. While this recommendation is specifically for JWT tokens, it provides a reference point for JSON-based security data.

=== Major Identity Providers
The typical sizes mentioned below are based on observations and may change. (Data last checked: 2025-06-02)

==== Auth0

* Typical JWKS size: 1-5 KB
* Contains 2-5 keys (mix of RSA and EC)

==== Okta

* Typical JWKS size: 2-10 KB
* Contains 3-10 keys (primarily RSA)

==== AWS Cognito

* Typical JWKS size: 1-3 KB
* Contains 1-3 keys (primarily RSA)

==== Microsoft Azure AD

* Typical JWKS size: 5-15 KB
* Contains 5-15 keys (mix of RSA and EC)

==== Google

* Typical JWKS size: 3-8 KB
* Contains 3-8 keys (mix of RSA and EC)

=== Key Rotation Considerations

Identity providers typically rotate keys periodically (e.g., every 90 days) and may keep multiple active keys to handle tokens issued with previous keys. This means a JWKS might contain:

* Current active signing key
* Previous signing key(s) (for validation of recently issued tokens)
* Next signing key (for upcoming rotation)
* Keys for different algorithms (RSA, EC, etc.)
* Keys for different purposes (signing, encryption, etc.)

== Recommendations for Upper Bounds

Based on the analysis above, here are the recommended upper bounds for JWKS content size:

=== Default Upper Bound: 64 KB

The default upper bound of 64 KB (65,536 bytes) is recommended for the following reasons:

1. It accommodates typical JWKS sizes from major identity providers (1-15 KB)
2. It provides room for growth as providers add more keys or use larger key sizes
3. It allows for key rotation scenarios where multiple keys are present
4. It is large enough to handle JWKS with 50-100 keys, which is more than sufficient for most use cases
5. It is small enough to prevent memory exhaustion attacks
6. It aligns with common HTTP response size limits

=== Conservative Upper Bound: 16 KB

For more conservative environments or resource-constrained systems, a 16 KB (16,384 bytes) limit may be appropriate:

1. It still accommodates typical JWKS sizes from major identity providers
2. It provides some room for growth and key rotation
3. It offers stronger protection against memory exhaustion attacks
4. It is suitable for most standard OAuth/OIDC deployments

=== Permissive Upper Bound: 256 KB

For environments with special requirements (e.g., many issuers, complex key rotation policies), a 256 KB (262,144 bytes) limit may be appropriate:

1. It accommodates very large JWKS with hundreds of keys
2. It provides ample room for future growth and complex key management scenarios
3. It should only be used in controlled environments with trusted issuers

== Implementation Recommendations

1. *Use the Default Upper Bound*: Set the default `maxPayloadSize` in `ParserConfig` to 64 KB (65,536 bytes) for JWKS content.

2. *Make the Limit Configurable*: Allow applications to configure the limit based on their specific requirements and risk profile.

3. *Log Warnings*: Log warnings when JWKS content approaches or exceeds the configured limit.

4. *Monitor JWKS Sizes*: Implement monitoring to track JWKS sizes over time and detect unusual growth.

5. *Implement Graceful Degradation*: When a JWKS exceeds the size limit, provide clear error messages and fallback mechanisms.

== Conclusion

The recommended default upper bound of 64 KB for JWKS content provides a good balance between security (preventing memory exhaustion attacks) and functionality (accommodating typical JWKS sizes and future growth). This limit should be configurable to allow applications to adjust it based on their specific requirements and risk profile.
