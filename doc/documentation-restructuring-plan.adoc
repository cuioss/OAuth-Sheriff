== Overview

This document outlines a plan to restructure the JWT validation library documentation to eliminate duplication and improve clarity. The current documentation structure contains some overlapping information across different files.

== Current Documentation Structure

=== Security Documentation

* `security-specifications.adoc` - Detailed specifications for security aspects, including JWT attack mitigations and OAuth security considerations
* `jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc` - Analysis of JWT vulnerabilities and mitigations
* `oauth-security-analysis.adoc` - Analysis of OAuth-related security vulnerabilities
* `Threat-Model.adoc` - Threat model and security analysis
* `threat-coverage-analysis.adoc` - Coverage analysis of threats identified in the threat model

=== Best Practices Guide

* `jwt-security-best-practices.adoc` - Comprehensive guide on JWT security best practices

== Identified Duplication

1. **JWT Attack Mitigations**
   * Detailed in `security-specifications.adoc`
   * Analyzed in `jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc`
   * Best practices in `jwt-security-best-practices.adoc`

2. **OAuth Security Considerations**
   * Detailed in `security-specifications.adoc`
   * Analyzed in `oauth-security-analysis.adoc`
   * Related best practices in `jwt-security-best-practices.adoc`

3. **Key Management**
   * Implementation details in `security-specifications.adoc`
   * Best practices in `jwt-security-best-practices.adoc`
   * Threat considerations in `Threat-Model.adoc`

== Restructuring Approach

The primary goal is to reduce duplication while maintaining a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Analysis Documents** (`jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc` and `oauth-security-analysis.adoc`) should focus on:
   * Vulnerability descriptions
   * Impact assessment
   * High-level mitigation strategies
   * References to implementation details

2. **Specification Document** (`security-specifications.adoc`) should focus on:
   * Implementation details
   * Class and method references
   * Technical approach
   * Test coverage

3. **Best Practices Guide** (`jwt-security-best-practices.adoc`) should focus on:
   * Application-level guidance
   * Configuration recommendations
   * Code examples
   * Integration patterns

By clarifying these boundaries, we can reduce duplication while ensuring each document serves its intended purpose.

== Specific Recommendations

=== 1. JWT Attacks Analysis Document

* **Keep**: Vulnerability descriptions, impact assessment, high-level mitigation strategies
* **Remove**: Detailed implementation specifics that are already in the specification document
* **Add**: Clear cross-references to the specification document for implementation details
* **Example Change**:
  * Change "The library implements the following measures: [detailed list]" to "The library implements mitigation measures as detailed in [link to security-specifications.adoc#section]"

=== 2. OAuth Security Analysis Document

* **Keep**: Vulnerability descriptions, impact assessment, high-level mitigation strategies
* **Remove**: Detailed implementation specifics that are already in the specification document
* **Add**: Clear cross-references to the specification document for implementation details
* **Example Change**:
  * Similar approach to the JWT attacks analysis document

=== 3. Security Specifications Document

* **Keep**: Detailed implementation information, class references, test coverage
* **Remove**: Duplicated vulnerability descriptions that are already in the analysis documents
* **Add**: Clear references to the analysis documents for vulnerability context
* **Reorganize**: Structure sections to align with the analysis documents for easier cross-referencing

=== 4. JWT Security Best Practices Guide

* **Keep**: Application-level guidance, configuration recommendations, code examples
* **Remove**: Library implementation details that are already in the specification document
* **Add**: Clear cross-references to the specification and analysis documents
* **Focus**: Emphasize how to use the library correctly rather than how the library works internally

== Implementation Plan

1. **First Phase**:
   * Update cross-references between documents
   * Add clear section headings for easier navigation
   * Ensure document navigation sections are consistent across all documents

2. **Second Phase**:
   * Remove duplicated content from `jwt-attacks-analysis.adoc` and `oauth-security-analysis.adoc`
   * Focus these documents on vulnerability analysis, not implementation details
   * Add clear cross-references to `security-specifications.adoc` for implementation details

3. **Third Phase**:
   * Remove duplicated content from `security-specifications.adoc`
   * Focus this document on implementation details, not vulnerability analysis
   * Add clear cross-references to the analysis documents for vulnerability context

4. **Fourth Phase**:
   * Update `jwt-security-best-practices.adoc` to focus on application-level guidance
   * Remove library implementation details from this document
   * Add clear cross-references to the specification and analysis documents

== Conclusion

By implementing these changes, we can create a more cohesive and less redundant documentation structure that better serves the needs of different audiences:

* **Security Researchers**: Analysis documents
* **Library Developers**: Specification document
* **Application Developers**: Best practices guide

Each document will have a clear purpose and scope, reducing duplication and making the documentation easier to maintain.
