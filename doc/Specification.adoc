== Overview
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-1[CUI-JWT-1: Token Parsing and Validation]_

This document provides the technical specification for the JWT token handling library. The specification details the implementation approach, architecture, and technical decisions to meet the requirements defined in the Requirements.adoc document.

== Document Structure

This specification is organized into the following documents:

* link:specification/technical-components.adoc[Technical Components] - Core implementation details for token parsing, validation, and management
* link:specification/security.adoc[Security] - Security measures and implementation details
* link:specification/token-decryption.adoc[Token Decryption] - Specifications for token decryption support (JWE)
* link:specification/testing.adoc[Testing] - Unit, integration, and security testing approach
* link:specification/token-size-validation.adoc[Token Size Validation] - Specifications for token size validation

== Architecture

=== Component Overview
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-1[CUI-JWT-1: Token Parsing and Validation]_

The JWT token handling library consists of the following main components:

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
package "JWT Token Handling" {
  [TokenFactory] ..> [JwtParser]
  [TokenFactory] ..> [ParsedToken]
  [MultiIssuerJwtParser] ..|> [JwtParser]
  [JwksAwareTokenParserImpl] ..|> [JwtParser]
  [NonValidatingJwtParser] ..|> [JwtParser]
  [JwtParser] ..> [JwksLoader]
  [JwksLoader] <.. [JwksLoaderFactory]
  [JwksLoaderFactory] ..> [HttpClient]
}

=== Component Descriptions

The following components form the core of the JWT token handling library. For detailed information about each component, including implementation status, class hierarchies, and test coverage, please refer to the link:specification/technical-components.adoc[Technical Components] document.

==== TokenFactory
_See Requirement CUI-JWT-2: Token Representation in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_

The primary entry point for applications using the library. It provides methods for creating and validating different types of tokens.

==== JwtParser
_See Requirement CUI-JWT-1.3: Signature Validation in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_

The interface that defines the contract for JWT token parsing and validation.

==== MultiIssuerJwtParser
_See Requirement CUI-JWT-3: Multi-Issuer Support in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_

Manages multiple JWT token parsers for different token issuers in a multi-tenant environment.

==== JwksLoader
_See Requirement CUI-JWT-4: Key Management in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_

Handles the retrieval, caching, and rotation of cryptographic keys used for token validation.

==== JwksLoaderFactory
_See Requirement CUI-JWT-4.1: JWKS Endpoint Support in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_

Responsible for creating instances of `JwksLoader` that fetch and parse JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) from remote endpoints.

==== NonValidatingJwtParser
_See Requirement CUI-JWT-5: Token Parsing in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_

A utility class for inspecting JWT token content without signature validation, used for preliminary token analysis.

==== ParsedToken
_See Requirement CUI-JWT-1.2: Token Types in link:Requirements.adoc[Requirements]_

An abstract base class for parsed JWT token representations that provides common functionality for working with JWT tokens.

== Implementation Details

For detailed information about the implementation of the JWT token handling library, please refer to the following documents:

* link:specification/technical-components.adoc[Technical Components] - Details about the implementation of core components
* link:specification/security.adoc[Security] - Details about security measures and implementation
* link:specification/token-size-validation.adoc[Token Size Validation] - Details about token size validation implementation
* link:specification/token-decryption.adoc[Token Decryption] - Details about token decryption support (future implementation)

== Testing Strategy
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-12[CUI-JWT-12: Testing and Quality Assurance]_

The testing strategy for the JWT token handling library includes unit testing, integration testing, security testing, and performance testing. For detailed information about the testing approach, please refer to the link:specification/testing.adoc[Testing] document.
