== Overview
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-1[CUI-JWT-1: Token Parsing and Validation]_

This document provides the technical specification for the JWT token handling library, which is being migrated from SmallRye JWT to JJWT (Java JWT: https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt). The specification details the implementation approach, architecture, and technical decisions to meet the requirements defined in the Requirements.adoc document.

== Document Structure

This specification is organized into the following documents:

* link:specification/technical-components.adoc[Technical Components] - Core implementation details for token parsing, validation, and management
* link:specification/security.adoc[Security] - Security measures and implementation details
* link:specification/logging.adoc[Logging] - Logging implementation details
* link:specification/testing.adoc[Testing] - Unit, integration, and security testing approach
* link:specification/migration.adoc[Migration] - Migration strategy from SmallRye JWT to JJWT

== Architecture

=== Component Overview
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-1[CUI-JWT-1: Token Parsing and Validation]_

The JWT token handling library consists of the following main components:

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
package "JWT Token Handling" {
  [TokenFactory] ..> [JwtParser]
  [TokenFactory] ..> [ParsedToken]
  [MultiIssuerTokenParser] ..|> [JwtParser]
  [JwksAwareTokenParser] ..|> [JwtParser]
  [NonValidatingJwtTokenParser] ..|> [JwtParser]
  [JwtParser] ..> [KeyManager]
  [KeyManager] ..> [JwksClient]
  [JwksClient] ..> [HttpClient]
}
@enduml
....

=== Component Descriptions

==== TokenFactory
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-2[CUI-JWT-2: Token Creation and Management]_

The `TokenFactory` is the primary entry point for applications using the library. It provides methods for creating and validating different types of tokens (access, ID, refresh) while handling the complexity of token parsing and validation.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/technical-components.adoc#_tokenfactory[TokenFactory].

==== JwtParser
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-1.3[CUI-JWT-1.3: Signature Validation]_

The `JwtParser` interface defines the contract for JWT token parsing and validation. It replaces the current `JwksAwareTokenParser` with a more abstract configuration structure.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/technical-components.adoc#_jwtparser[JwtParser].

==== MultiIssuerTokenParser
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-3[CUI-JWT-3: Multi-Issuer Support]_

The `MultiIssuerTokenParser` manages multiple JWT token parsers for different token issuers in a multi-tenant environment. It inspects JWT tokens, determines their issuer, and selects the appropriate parser.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/technical-components.adoc#_multiissuertokenparser[MultiIssuerTokenParser].

==== KeyManager
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-4[CUI-JWT-4: Key Management]_

The `KeyManager` handles the retrieval, caching, and rotation of cryptographic keys used for token validation.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/technical-components.adoc#_keymanager[KeyManager].

==== JwksClient
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-4.1[CUI-JWT-4.1: JWKS Support]_

The `JwksClient` is responsible for fetching and parsing JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) from remote endpoints.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/technical-components.adoc#_jwksclient[JwksClient].

==== ParsedToken
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-1.2[CUI-JWT-1.2: Token Types]_

The `ParsedToken` is an abstract base class for parsed JWT token representations. It provides common functionality for working with JWT tokens.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/technical-components.adoc#_parsedtoken[ParsedToken].

== Implementation Details

=== Token Parsing and Validation
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-1[CUI-JWT-1: Token Parsing and Validation]_

The token parsing and validation process follows these steps:

1. The token string is received by the `TokenFactory`
2. The `MultiIssuerTokenParser` extracts the issuer from the token without validating the signature
3. The appropriate `JwtParser` is selected based on the issuer
4. The selected parser validates the token signature using keys from the `KeyManager`
5. If validation succeeds, a typed token instance is created and returned

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/technical-components.adoc#_token_parsing_and_validation[Token Parsing and Validation].

=== Signature Validation
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-1.3[CUI-JWT-1.3: Signature Validation]_

The library supports specific signature algorithms as specified in the requirements.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/security.adoc#_signature_validation[Signature Validation].

=== Key Management
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-4[CUI-JWT-4: Key Management]_

The key management implementation includes JWKS endpoint support, key caching, key rotation, and local key support.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/technical-components.adoc#_keymanager[Key Management].

=== Multi-Issuer Support
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-3[CUI-JWT-3: Multi-Issuer Support]_

The library supports tokens from multiple issuers through issuer configuration, selection, and validation.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/technical-components.adoc#_multiissuertokenparser[Multi-Issuer Support].

=== Security Measures
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-8[CUI-JWT-8: Security Requirements]_

The implementation includes security measures such as algorithm restrictions, key length requirements, and claim validation.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/security.adoc[Security].

=== Logging
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-7[CUI-JWT-7: Logging Requirements]_

The implementation follows the CUI logging standards.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/logging.adoc[Logging].

== Migration Strategy
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-6[CUI-JWT-6: Migration Requirements]_

The migration strategy includes interface preservation, implementation changes, and a step-by-step migration plan.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/migration.adoc[Migration].

== Testing Strategy
_See Requirement link:Requirements.adoc#CUI-JWT-5[CUI-JWT-5: Testing Requirements]_

The testing strategy includes unit testing, integration testing, security testing, and performance testing.

For detailed specifications, see link:specification/testing.adoc[Testing].
