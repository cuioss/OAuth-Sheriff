* Access tokens
* ID tokens
* Refresh tokens


[#CUI-JWT-1.3]
==== CUI-JWT-1.3: Signature Validation

The library must validate token signatures using cryptographic algorithms as specified in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518[RFC 7518 - JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)].

For security reasons, only the following signature algorithms shall be supported (in accordance with https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bcp-09[OAuth 2.0 JWT Best Current Practices] (July 2023) and https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf[NIST SP 800-131A] (March 2019)):

* RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256)
* RS384 (RSA Signature with SHA-384)
* RS512 (RSA Signature with SHA-512)
* ES256 (ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256)
* ES384 (ECDSA using P-384 and SHA-384)
* ES512 (ECDSA using P-521 and SHA-512)

The following algorithms shall NOT be supported due to security concerns:

* HS256, HS384, HS512 (HMAC with SHA-2) - Vulnerable to https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/[key confusion attacks] (2015) when used in combination with RSA public keys
* "none" algorithm - Explicitly forbidden by https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bcp-09#section-3.1[OAuth 2.0 JWT BCP Section 3.1] and https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html[CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature]
* RS1, RS256-512 with keys shorter than 2048 bits - Not compliant with https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf[NIST SP 800-131A] (2019)
* All RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithms - Considered legacy by https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8017.html#section-8.2[RFC 8017] (2016) in favor of RSASSA-PSS

Additional security considerations:

* The library must implement https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-jwt-bcp-09#section-3.10[algorithm verification] to prevent algorithm substitution attacks (CVE-2015-9235)
