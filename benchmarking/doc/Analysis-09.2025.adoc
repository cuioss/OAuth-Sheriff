**Key Findings:**

* **50 connections** is the sweet spot for CI/CD - excellent performance across all metrics
* **100 connections** marks JWT degradation beginning (CPU 87.1%, P90 2.6x slower than baseline)
* **150 connections** provides good stress testing balance (no timeouts, moderate degradation)
* **200+ connections** causes severe JWT degradation (P90 5-8x slower, CPU approaches saturation)
* **Health checks** scale excellently up to 200 connections, then degrade gradually
* **Thread count** grows linearly with connections, reaching 200+ threads at maximum load

=== Bottleneck Identification

**Root Cause: Docker Bridge Networking** ðŸŽ¯

Testing inside Docker network (container-to-container) vs host-to-container revealed network overhead:

* **Container-to-container** (50 conns, health): 0.91ms avg latency, 74.3K ops/s
* **Host-to-container** (50 conns, health): 1.0ms P50 / 2.48ms P90, 37.6K ops/s (standard test setup)
* **Improvement**: ~2x throughput when bypassing Docker bridge (host network stack)
* **Conclusion**: Application is performant. Docker bridge adds overhead. Production Kubernetes pod-to-pod networking performs better.

**Secondary Bottlenecks (Application-Level):**

1. **JWT processing overhead** (32,900 ops/s gap from health check)
2. **Token cache disabled** - Every validation performs full crypto (maxSize=0)
3. **JWKS refresh every 10 seconds** - Constant Keycloak communication overhead

=== Performance Ceiling

* **Health check capacity**: 50,300 ops/s (excellent scaling)
* **JWT validation capacity**: 17,400 ops/s (moderate stress)
* **Performance gap**: 32,900 ops/s between health and JWT endpoints
* **CPU bottleneck**: Begins at 100 connections (87% CPU)

== Conclusion

WRK stress testing with 150 connections reveals:

* **Health endpoint**: 50,300 ops/s with 2.35ms P50 / 7.0ms P90 latency
* **JWT endpoint**: 17,400 ops/s with 7.32ms P50 / 22.64ms P90 latency
* **Container-to-container test** (50 conns, health only): 74.3K ops/s (0.91ms) shows ~2x improvement over standard host-to-container setup (37.6K ops/s)
* **Test profiles**: 50 connections (default), 150 connections (stress), 300 connections (max load)
* **Primary bottleneck**: JWT cryptographic validation overhead
* **Infrastructure finding**: Container networking has less overhead than host-to-container Docker bridge
