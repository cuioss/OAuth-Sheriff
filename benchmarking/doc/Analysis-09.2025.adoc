**Key Findings:**

* **50 connections** is the sweet spot for CI/CD - excellent performance across all metrics
* **100 connections** marks JWT degradation beginning (CPU 87.1%, P90 2.6x slower than baseline)
* **150 connections** provides good stress testing balance (no timeouts, moderate degradation)
* **200+ connections** causes severe JWT degradation (P90 5-8x slower, CPU approaches saturation)
* **Health checks** scale excellently up to 200 connections, then degrade gradually
* **Thread count** grows linearly with connections, reaching 200+ threads at maximum load

=== Bottleneck Identification

1. **CPU approaches saturation** (82.7% utilization at 150 connections)
2. **JWT processing overhead** (33,845 ops/s gap from health check)
3. **Token cache disabled** - Every validation performs full crypto (maxSize=0)
4. **JWKS refresh every 10 seconds** - Constant Keycloak communication overhead
5. **No timeouts** - 150 connections is stable (vs 139 timeouts at 300 connections)
6. **Connection scaling** - Performance degrades gracefully up to 150, then sharply beyond 200

=== Performance Ceiling

* **Health check capacity**: 50,565 ops/s (excellent scaling)
* **JWT validation capacity**: 16,720 ops/s (moderate stress)
* **Performance gap**: 33,845 ops/s between health and JWT endpoints
* **CPU bottleneck**: Begins at 100 connections (87% CPU)

=== Log Analysis Insights

Latest benchmark with optimized connection count (150) shows:

* **File logging configured** - Logs written directly to target directory without console I/O
* **Performance improved** - JWT throughput at 16,720 ops/s (30% improvement from 300-connection test)
* **Zero timeouts** - Stable performance at 150 connections (vs 139 timeouts at 300)
* **Optimized connection count** - 150 connections provides stress testing without severe degradation
* **Virtual threads** - Efficiently handling 150+ concurrent connections
* **Token cache disabled** - Still at `maxSize=0` for benchmark accuracy

== Implications for Issue #113

The target of 50-100k ops/s requires architectural changes:

* **Current achievement**: 16,720 ops/s (33% of minimum target)
* **Gap to target**: 33,280 ops/s minimum
* **Required improvement**: 200-500% increase

=== Profile Recommendations

Based on the connection bottleneck investigation:

1. **Default (50 connections)**: Optimal for CI/CD - excellent performance with P90 < 6ms
2. **Stress (150 connections)**: Good for stress testing - moderate degradation, no timeouts
3. **Max (300 connections)**: Tests limits - severe degradation, expect failures

=== Required Changes for 50k+ ops/s

1. **Embedded JWKS keys** - Eliminate Keycloak network calls
2. **Token caching** - Enable access token cache to reduce crypto operations
3. **Horizontal scaling** - Multiple instances with load balancing
4. **Connection optimization** - Keep connections below 150 for stable performance

== Conclusion

WRK stress testing with optimized connection count (150) reveals a performance ceiling of approximately 16.7k ops/s for JWT validation. The systematic investigation identified that:

* **50 connections** provides the best balance for regular testing (P90 5.8ms, CPU 76%)
* **100 connections** marks the beginning of JWT degradation (CPU 87%, P90 15ms)
* **150 connections** offers good stress testing without severe issues
* **300 connections** causes critical degradation (P90 46ms, 8x slower than baseline)

The health check baseline of 50.6k ops/s demonstrates the HTTP stack can handle significantly higher throughput. The performance gap (33.8k ops/s) indicates JWT validation overhead is the primary bottleneck, approaching CPU saturation at moderate load.
