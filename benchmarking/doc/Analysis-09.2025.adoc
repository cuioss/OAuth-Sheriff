= JWT Validation Benchmark Analysis - September 2025
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble
:icons: font

== Executive Summary

This document presents the results of JWT validation benchmarks conducted using two different load testing approaches:

1. **WRK Benchmark**: HTTP-based load testing with WRK (7-minute duration)
2. **Quarkus JMH Benchmark**: Java-based micro-benchmarking with JMH (extended duration)

Both benchmarks test the same Quarkus native application running in a distroless container with Keycloak as the JWT issuer.

== Test Environment

* **Platform**: macOS Darwin 24.6.0 (ARM64)
* **CPU**: 4 cores available
* **Java Version**: OpenJDK 21.0.7 (Temurin)
* **Quarkus**: Native compilation with Mandrel 23.1.8.0
* **Container**: Distroless image (111MB)
* **Keycloak**: Version 26.2.5

== Key Observations

=== Performance Characteristics

1. **Throughput**: The Quarkus JMH benchmark achieved significantly higher throughput (21,966 req/s) compared to WRK (7,020 req/s), approximately 3x better performance.

2. **CPU Utilization**:
   - WRK benchmark used minimal CPU at 2.5%, indicating the benchmark wasn't pushing the system hard enough
   - JMH benchmark used 57% CPU, showing better system utilization without saturation

3. **Memory Usage**:
   - Both benchmarks showed excellent memory efficiency
   - WRK: 29 MB heap
   - JMH: 27 MB heap
   - Native Quarkus application maintains low memory footprint under load

4. **Response Times**:
   - JMH showed better average latency (46 μs) compared to WRK (142 μs)
   - Both maintained sub-millisecond average response times
   - Max latency similar in both benchmarks (~100-120ms)

=== Benchmark Methodology Differences

| 24 JMH threads

| Duration
| ~6 minutes runtime
| ~28 minutes runtime

| Measurement
| End-to-end including network
| Focused on application logic
|===

== Conclusions

1. **Outstanding performance achieved**: The JWT validation service handles 7,000-22,000 requests per second with microsecond-level latency.

2. **Native compilation benefits confirmed**:
   - Fast startup times (~200ms for native app)
   - Minimal memory footprint (27-29 MB heap)
   - Efficient CPU utilization

3. **JMH provides superior load generation**: The JMH benchmark achieved 3x higher throughput by better utilizing system resources (57% CPU vs 2.5%).

4. **WRK may need tuning**: The low CPU usage in WRK suggests it needs more aggressive parameters (more threads/connections) to fully stress the system.

== Recommendations

1. **For capacity planning**: Use JMH results (21,966 req/s at 57% CPU) as they better utilize system resources
2. **WRK configuration**: Increase threads and connections to better stress the system (current settings too conservative)
3. **Memory is highly optimized**: With only 27-29 MB heap usage, the application scales excellently
4. **Benchmark duration**: For accurate results, use shorter iterations (2-3 minutes) with proper warmup
