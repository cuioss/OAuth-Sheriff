* **Container Headroom**: At 72.9%, JWT validation uses ~73% of available container CPU (4 cores)
* **Linear Scaling**: CPU usage scales linearly with workload complexity
====

==== Key Resource Observations

* **Metrics Accuracy**: Fixed timestamp-based collection now provides accurate per-benchmark CPU metrics (previously all benchmarks incorrectly showed identical values)
* **CPU Utilization**: JWT validation (72.9%) requires 2.5× more CPU than health checks (29.3%), reflecting the cryptographic overhead
* **Container Awareness**: Both process_cpu_usage and system_cpu_usage report identical values, confirming the JVM is the primary resource consumer
* **Performance Headroom**: At 72.9% CPU for JWT validation, the system maintains ~27% headroom before reaching container limits
* **Memory Stability**: All benchmarks maintain low memory footprint (9.1-15.9 MB average) with zero GC overhead
* **Thread Management**: WRK maintains fewer threads (31-34) compared to JMH (32-42), reflecting different connection handling strategies

=== Key Findings from CPU Scaling

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: The WRK benchmark configuration was using fixed values:
- Only 4 threads (regardless of available CPU cores)
- Only 20 connections (insufficient to saturate higher core counts)

This explains the paradoxical results where more CPUs led to LOWER utilization.

1. **Non-linear Scaling**: Performance does NOT scale linearly with CPU cores
   - 4→6 cores: +32% throughput improvement (best gain)
   - 6→8 cores: -13% throughput (performance degradation!)
   - 8→10 cores: +3.5% throughput (minimal improvement)

2. **Diminishing Returns**: Beyond 6 cores, adding more CPUs provides no benefit
   - Peak performance: 10,655 ops/s at 6 cores
   - Efficiency drops from 2,021 ops/s per core (4 cores) to 961 ops/s per core (10 cores)

3. **CPU Utilization Paradox EXPLAINED**:
   - 4 cores: 98.1% utilization (4 threads fully utilizing 4 cores)
   - 6 cores: 89.5% utilization (4 threads cannot fully utilize 6 cores)
   - 8 cores: 64.6% utilization (4 threads heavily underutilize 8 cores)
   - 10 cores: 52.8% utilization (4 threads massively underutilize 10 cores)

4. **The Real Bottleneck**: INSUFFICIENT LOAD GENERATION
   - WRK using only 4 threads cannot generate enough load for 6+ cores
   - Need to scale threads proportionally: 6 threads for 6 cores, 8 for 8 cores, etc.
   - Connections should also scale: 30-50 connections per scenario
   - **Tests need to be re-run with proper WRK configuration**

=== Actual Re-testing Results with Proper WRK Configuration

Tests were re-run with 10 CPUs and properly scaled WRK threads and connections:

=== Key Findings from Proper Load Testing

1. **WRK Configuration Critical**: Properly scaling threads/connections increased throughput by 48%
   - 4 threads could not saturate 10 CPUs (only 52.8% utilization)
   - 10 threads with 300 connections achieved optimal performance
   - 400 connections caused severe degradation (connection overhead)
   - **Stress profile validation**: Repeated tests with 10t/300c configuration consistently achieve ~14,173 ops/s

2. **Actual Performance Ceiling**: **14,264 ops/s** with optimal configuration
   - 48% better than initial testing with inadequate load generation
   - Still far below the 50-100k ops/s target
   - CPU usage peaked at 73.1% (still not fully saturated!)

3. **Latency Trade-offs**:
   - Low load (4t/20c): 2.2ms excellent latency
   - Optimal load (10t/300c): 75.9ms acceptable latency
   - Overload (10t/400c): 127.9ms unacceptable with performance collapse

4. **The Real Bottleneck Analysis**:
   - **NOT pure CPU saturation** (only 73.1% at peak performance)
   - JWKS resolution and caching overhead
   - Connection pool management limitations
   - Possible lock contention in shared resources
   - Virtual threads handled 121 concurrent threads efficiently

=== JMH Stress Profile Results (96 threads)

Tests were run with JMH stress profile (96 threads, 60s duration) for comparison with WRK:

==== JMH Integration Benchmark Performance (Stress Profile)

[cols="2,2,2,2,2", options="header"]
|===
|Benchmark
|Threads
|Throughput
|Comparison to Default
|Comparison to WRK

|Health Check
|96 threads

|JWT Validation
|96 threads
|8,291 ops/s
|-0.5% vs 32 threads (8,333 ops/s)
|-41% vs WRK stress (14,173 ops/s)
|===

==== Key Observations from JMH Stress Testing

1. **Thread Scaling Limitations**:
   - Health check improved slightly (+15%) with 3x threads
   - JWT validation remained flat (-0.5%) despite 3x threads
   - JMH's Java HTTP client appears to be the bottleneck

2. **WRK vs JMH Performance Gap**:
   - WRK achieves 71% higher throughput for JWT validation
   - WRK achieves 107% higher throughput for health checks
   - Native C-based HTTP client (WRK) significantly outperforms Java HTTP client (JMH)

3. **Resource Utilization**:
   - GC overhead: 172ms for health, 104ms for JWT (minimal impact)
   - Thread states: 46-69% WAITING, indicating I/O bottlenecks
   - Only 1.6-2.3% of threads in RUNNABLE state

=== Implications for Issue #113

With properly configured load testing:
- **Maximum achieved**: 14,264 ops/s (10 cores with proper WRK config)
- **JMH ceiling**: 8,291 ops/s (96 threads, stress profile)
- **Theoretical limit**: ~20k ops/s if CPU could reach 100% utilization
- **50-100k ops/s target**: Architecturally impossible without fundamental changes
- **Required changes for 50k+**:
  - Embedded JWKS keys (eliminate Keycloak network calls)
  - Async/reactive architecture throughout
  - Possible gRPC instead of HTTP/REST
  - Horizontal scaling across multiple instances

== Conclusion

Both benchmarks successfully completed with the Quarkus native application demonstrating:

- Sub-200ms native startup times
- JWT validation throughput of ~8,400 operations per second (average)
- Health check response times in the millisecond range
- Excellent performance grades (A) for both testing approaches
- Outstanding resource efficiency: 45.5% average CPU, 11.6 MB average heap, 0% GC overhead

The performance results show excellent alignment between WRK and JMH benchmarks:

- Both tests use HTTP calls to the same endpoints as verified by code analysis
- JWT validation performance is very well-aligned (8,737 vs 8,333 ops/s - 5% difference)
- Health check performance shows expected differences (18,418 vs 11,292 ops/s - 63% difference)
- The differences can be attributed to:
  * Different HTTP client implementations (WRK's C-based vs JMH's Java-based)
  * Different connection pooling strategies (JMH uses 24 threads vs WRK uses 4)
  * WRK's lighter-weight HTTP client architecture

Unit conversion issue successfully resolved:
- **Fixed**: JMH results now correctly convert ops/ms to ops/s (multiply by 1000)
- **Verified**: All throughput results are now in proper ops/s units
- **Impact**: Excellent alignment achieved between WRK and JMH benchmarks

Key achievements:

1. **Excellent performance grades** - Both benchmarks achieve Grade A performance
2. **JWT validation alignment** - Only 8% difference between testing approaches
3. **Unit conversion fixed** - All throughput results are now correctly displayed
4. **Outstanding resource efficiency** - CPU utilization properly reflects workload, 9.1-15.9 MB heap average, 0% GC overhead
5. **Stable performance** - Both tests demonstrate consistent native application behavior

== Keycloak Baseline Performance
