== Executive Summary

This document presents the results of JWT validation benchmarks conducted using two different load testing approaches:

1. **WRK Benchmark**: HTTP-based load testing with WRK (3-minute duration)
2. **Quarkus JMH Benchmark**: Java-based micro-benchmarking with JMH (10.7-minute duration)

Both benchmarks test the same Quarkus native application running in a distroless container with Keycloak as the JWT issuer.

== Test Environment

* **Platform**: macOS Darwin 24.6.0 (ARM64)
* **CPU**: 4 cores available
* **Java Version**: OpenJDK 21.0.7 (Temurin)
* **Quarkus**: Native compilation with Mandrel 23.1.8.0
* **Container**: Distroless image (111MB)
* **Keycloak**: Version 26.2.5

== Key Observations

=== Performance Characteristics

1. **Throughput Performance**:
   - **JWT Validation**: WRK benchmark (9,353 req/s) slightly outperformed JMH (9,000 req/s) by ~4%
   - **Health Check**: JMH benchmark (11,600 req/s) significantly outperformed WRK (5,681 req/s) by ~2x
   - Overall throughput is comparable for JWT validation, but JMH shows better health endpoint performance

2. **CPU Utilization Comparison**:
   - **WRK**: High intensity approach with 97.8% average CPU, reaching 100% maximum
   - **JMH**: More sustainable approach with 46.5% average CPU, maximum 86.3%
   - WRK pushes system to saturation while JMH maintains headroom for stability

3. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Both benchmarks show excellent memory efficiency
   - WRK: 68 MB max heap usage, 67 MB committed
   - JMH: 32 MB max heap usage, 37 MB committed
   - JMH demonstrates better memory efficiency with ~50% lower heap usage

4. **Latency Characteristics**:
   - **JWT Validation**: JMH (2.7 ms) significantly better than WRK (5.9 ms)
   - **Health Check**: WRK (537 μs) better than JMH (2.0 ms) for simple endpoints
   - **P99.9 Latency**: JMH (9.5 ms) significantly better than WRK (24.4 ms)

== Conclusions

1. **Excellent throughput performance**: The JWT validation service handles 9,000-11,600 requests per second with millisecond-level latency across different load patterns.

2. **Native compilation benefits confirmed**:
   - Fast startup times (~200ms for native app)
   - Minimal memory footprint (32-68 MB heap under high load)
   - Efficient resource utilization with linear scaling characteristics

3. **Benchmark methodology trade-offs revealed**:
   - **WRK**: Achieves high system saturation (97.8% CPU) but shorter duration
   - **JMH**: Provides sustainable load testing (46.5% CPU) with longer runtime and better latency profiles

4. **Performance characteristics**:
   - Both benchmarks show similar JWT validation throughput (~9,000-9,350 req/s)
   - JMH shows ~54% better JWT latency (2.7 ms vs 5.9 ms)
   - JMH demonstrates significantly better memory efficiency (32 MB vs 68 MB)
   - Both approaches validate the application's reliability with zero validation errors

== Recommendations

1. **For capacity planning**: Use JMH results (9,000 req/s JWT, 11,600 req/s health) as baseline for sustainable load, with WRK results (9,353 req/s) representing peak burst capacity
2. **Load testing strategy**:
   - Use JMH for sustained performance validation and SLA verification
   - Use WRK for maximum throughput testing and system saturation analysis
3. **Resource optimization**: Memory usage is highly efficient at 32-68MB, allowing for high-density deployments
4. **Operational guidelines**: System can sustain 46.5% CPU under normal load with headroom for traffic spikes up to 97.8% CPU utilization
