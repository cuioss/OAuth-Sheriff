**Key Findings:**

* **Identical Values**: process_cpu_usage = system_cpu_usage indicates the JVM is the sole CPU consumer
* **2.5× Factor**: JWT validation requires 2.5× more CPU than health checks
* **Container Headroom**: At 72.9%, JWT validation uses ~73% of available container CPU (4 cores)
* **Linear Scaling**: CPU usage scales linearly with workload complexity
====

==== Key Resource Observations

* **Metrics Accuracy**: Fixed timestamp-based collection now provides accurate per-benchmark CPU metrics (previously all benchmarks incorrectly showed identical values)
* **CPU Utilization**: JWT validation (72.9%) requires 2.5× more CPU than health checks (29.3%), reflecting the cryptographic overhead
* **Container Awareness**: Both process_cpu_usage and system_cpu_usage report identical values, confirming the JVM is the primary resource consumer
* **Performance Headroom**: At 72.9% CPU for JWT validation, the system maintains ~27% headroom before reaching container limits
* **Memory Stability**: All benchmarks maintain low memory footprint (9.1-15.9 MB average) with zero GC overhead
* **Thread Management**: WRK maintains fewer threads (31-34) compared to JMH (32-42), reflecting different connection handling strategies

== Conclusion

Both benchmarks successfully completed with the Quarkus native application demonstrating:

- Sub-200ms native startup times
- JWT validation throughput of ~8,400 operations per second (average)
- Health check response times in the millisecond range
- Excellent performance grades (A) for both testing approaches
- Outstanding resource efficiency: 45.5% average CPU, 11.6 MB average heap, 0% GC overhead

The performance results show excellent alignment between WRK and JMH benchmarks:

- Both tests use HTTP calls to the same endpoints as verified by code analysis
- JWT validation performance is very well-aligned (8,737 vs 8,333 ops/s - 5% difference)
- Health check performance shows expected differences (18,418 vs 11,292 ops/s - 63% difference)
- The differences can be attributed to:
  * Different HTTP client implementations (WRK's C-based vs JMH's Java-based)
  * Different connection pooling strategies (JMH uses 24 threads vs WRK uses 4)
  * WRK's lighter-weight HTTP client architecture
