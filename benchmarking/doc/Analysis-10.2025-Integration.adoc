**Key Findings:**

* **100 connections** achieves peak health throughput (77.1K ops/s) - optimal balance point
* **JWT performance** remains remarkably stable (20.1-21.6K ops/s) across all connection counts
* **50 connections** provides excellent baseline (66.9K ops/s health, 21.6K ops/s JWT) for CI/CD
* **150-250 connections** maintains consistent 70K ops/s health throughput with stable JWT performance
* **300 connections** shows slight degradation (67.9K ops/s health) but JWT remains stable at 20.4K ops/s
* **Cache effectiveness** confirmed with 100% hit rate across all runs (cache size 20)

=== Bottleneck Identification

**Root Cause: Docker Bridge Networking** ðŸŽ¯

Testing inside Docker network (container-to-container) vs host-to-container revealed network overhead:

* **Container-to-container** (50 conns, health): 0.91ms avg latency, 74.3K ops/s
* **Host-to-container** (50 conns, health): 0.573ms P50 / 1.76ms P90, 66.9K ops/s (standard test setup)
* **Improvement**: +11% throughput when bypassing Docker bridge (host network stack)
* **Conclusion**: Application is performant. Docker bridge adds overhead. Production Kubernetes pod-to-pod networking performs better.

**Observed Characteristics:**

1. **Throughput gap** - 55,700 ops/s difference between health and JWT endpoints (both use same HTTP/REST stack, gap due to endpoint implementation)
2. **Token cache effectiveness** - Cache size of 20 achieved 100% hit rate (239,156/239,156 validations), providing 7.4% throughput improvement
3. **Library validation time** - 53Âµs (0.053ms) P50 from JMH micro-benchmark
4. **JWKS refresh** - Periodic Keycloak communication for public key updates

=== JWT Validation Performance Breakdown

**Integration test latency (WRK):**

- **50 connections baseline**: 2.05ms P50, 4.24ms P90, 11.16ms P99 (21.6K ops/s)
- **150 connections stress**: 6.30ms P50, 17.55ms P90, 39.38ms P99 (20.4K ops/s, cache OFF)
- **150 connections stress**: 5.88ms P50, 16.16ms P90, 39.98ms P99 (21.9K ops/s, cache ON)

**Library-only performance (JMH micro-benchmark):**

- **Micro-benchmark P50**: 53Âµs (0.053ms) at 108,400 ops/s
- **Integration overhead**: 6.247ms (6.30ms - 0.053ms = **119x slower** than isolated library)
- **Throughput degradation**: 5x slower (108.4K ops/s micro vs 21.6K ops/s integration)

**Integration overhead breakdown (6.247ms):**

The 119x performance degradation from micro-benchmark (53Âµs) to integration (6.3ms) includes:

- HTTP request/response processing (Docker bridge networking)
- REST framework overhead (JAX-RS, Quarkus routing)
- CDI request-scoped bean creation and context management
- JSON response serialization
- Token claims extraction and response building
- Network I/O and TCP/TLS processing

**Note:** Individual contribution of each component is unmeasured - requires profiling to quantify.

=== Performance Ceiling

* **Health check capacity**: 77.1K ops/s at 100 connections (peak performance)
* **JWT validation capacity**: 21.6K ops/s at 50-100 connections (cache enabled, 100% hit rate)
* **Performance gap**: 55.5K ops/s between health and JWT endpoints at peak
* **Stability range**: JWT maintains 20.1-21.6K ops/s across 50-300 connections (excellent stability)

**Throughput gap explanation:**

The 3.5x throughput difference (77K health vs 22K JWT) is primarily due to:

- **Latency difference**: JWT 2.05-6.30ms vs Health 0.573-1.75ms (depends on connection count)
- **Higher thread usage**: JWT uses more threads (67 avg vs 36 avg at 50 conns)
- **Higher CPU usage**: JWT uses 13% more CPU (78% vs 69% at 50 conns)

**What we know:** Both endpoints use the same HTTP/REST/Quarkus/Docker stack. The gap is caused by differences in endpoint implementation. **What we don't know:** Exact breakdown of where the 1.5ms difference (at 50 conns) comes from - requires profiling to measure.

== Conclusion

Comprehensive WRK stress testing across 50-300 connections reveals:

* **Peak performance**: 77.1K ops/s health (100 conns), 21.6K ops/s JWT (50-100 conns)
* **Excellent stability**: JWT maintains 20.1-21.6K ops/s across all connection counts (50-300)
* **Optimal configuration**: 100 connections provides best balance (77.1K health, 21.6K JWT)
* **Latency characteristics**: Health 0.573-3.77ms P50, JWT 2.05-12.93ms P50 (scales linearly with connections)
* **Cache effectiveness**: Lock-free cache achieves 100% hit rate (size 20), zero performance collapse
* **Library performance**: Core library validates in 53Âµs (0.053ms) - extremely fast in isolation
* **Integration overhead**: 119x slower in integration (6.3ms vs 0.053ms) due to HTTP/REST framework stack, not cryptographic validation bottleneck
* **Health vs JWT gap**: 55.5K ops/s difference - both use same HTTP/REST/Docker infrastructure, gap due to endpoint implementation differences (exact breakdown unmeasured)
