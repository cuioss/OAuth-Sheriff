= JWT Performance Scoring System
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

== Overview

A weighted performance score combining throughput, latency, and error resilience into a single metric.

== Formula

[source,text]
----
Performance Score = (Throughput_Score × 0.5) + (Latency_Score × 0.5)

Where:
- Throughput_Score = Throughput ÷ 100        // 10000 ops/s = score 100 (uncapped)
- Latency_Score = 100 ÷ Latency_ms          // 1 ms = score 100 (uncapped)
- Throughput = Average operations/second from benchmarks
- Latency_ms = Average latency in milliseconds

Note: Scores are not capped, allowing exceptional performance to exceed 100
----

== Metrics

=== Throughput (50% weight)

* Measures: Average operations per second across all throughput benchmarks
* Score normalized: 10,000 ops/s = 100 points
* Higher is better, no upper limit

=== Latency (50% weight)

* Measures: Average latency across all latency benchmarks
* Score normalized: 1 ms = 100 points (inverse relationship)
* Lower is better, no upper limit on score

== Score Interpretation

|===
|Score Range |Grade |Description

|≥ 90
|A
|Excellent performance - high-scale production ready

|75-89
|B
|Good performance - suitable for most production scenarios

|60-74
|C
|Adequate performance - typical applications

|40-59
|D
|Below average - optimization recommended

|< 40
|F
|Poor performance - optimization required

== Example Calculation

----
Integration Benchmark:
Average Throughput: 5,847 ops/sec
Average Latency: 1.17 ms

Throughput_Score = 5847 ÷ 100 = 58.47
Latency_Score = 100 ÷ 1.17 = 85.47

Performance Score = (58.47 × 0.5) + (85.47 × 0.5)
                  = 29.24 + 42.74
                  = 71.98 (Grade C)

Micro Benchmark:
Average Throughput: 83,909 ops/sec  
Average Latency: 0.35 ms

Throughput_Score = 83909 ÷ 100 = 839.09
Latency_Score = 100 ÷ 0.35 = 285.71

Performance Score = (839.09 × 0.5) + (285.71 × 0.5)
                  = 419.55 + 142.86
                  = 562.41 (Grade A, exceptional performance)

                   |      |            └─ Average validation time
                   |      └─ Throughput (rounded)
                   └─ Weighted score

== Usage

* **Regression Detection**: Track performance over releases
* **Optimization Tracking**: Measure improvement impact
* **Capacity Planning**: Understand performance characteristics

== Limitations

* Environment dependent (hardware, JVM settings)
* Based on synthetic test tokens
* Single library performance only

== Best Practices

1. Focus on trends over absolute values
2. Use consistent test environments
3. Run multiple iterations for accuracy
4. Consider context when interpreting results
