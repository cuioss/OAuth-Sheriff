# SSL Certificate Management for Benchmarks

## Current State

The benchmark system currently uses `trustAllCerts` configuration which accepts ANY certificate from ANY server. While this works for testing, it's not secure even in test environments as it's vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Security Issue with Current Approach

```java
// Current insecure approach - accepts ALL certificates
TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[] {
    new X509TrustManager() {
        public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain, String authType) {}
        public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] chain, String authType) {}
        public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() { return new X509Certificate[0]; }
    }
};
```

**Problems:**
- No certificate validation whatsoever
- Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
- Accepts malicious certificates
- Not following security best practices

## Improved Approach: Custom TrustManager

Replace the trust-all approach with a **Custom TrustManager** that only trusts specific test certificates.

### Benefits

1. **Security**: Only trusts known test certificates (e.g., localhost self-signed cert)
2. **Flexibility**: Falls back to standard SSL validation if test cert not found
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to update when test certificates change
4. **Production-ready**: Can be configured for real certificates

### Implementation Strategy

#### Option 1: Specific Certificate Trust (Recommended)
- Load the specific `localhost.crt` certificate used by benchmark services
- Create a custom TrustManager that only accepts this certificate
- Maintain hostname verification limited to `localhost`

#### Option 2: Certificate Pinning
- Pin the SHA256 fingerprint of the test certificate
- Use OkHttp's built-in certificate pinning feature
- More resilient to certificate changes

#### Option 3: Environment-Based Configuration
- Allow switching between security modes via system properties
- `benchmark.ssl.mode`: `secure`, `custom`, `pinned`, or `insecure` (fallback)
- Default to secure mode, explicitly opt-in to test modes

### Certificate Locations

Current test certificates are located at:
- Docker: `/app/certificates/localhost.crt`, `/app/certificates/localhost.key`
- Source: `cui-jwt-quarkus-integration-tests/src/main/docker/certificates/`

### Hostname Verification

Instead of accepting all hostnames:
```java
.hostnameVerifier((hostname, session) -> true) // Insecure - accepts ANY hostname
```

Use specific hostname validation:
```java
.hostnameVerifier((hostname, session) -> "localhost".equals(hostname)) // Only localhost
```

### Configuration Properties

Proposed system properties for SSL configuration:
- `benchmark.ssl.mode` - SSL validation mode (`secure`, `custom`, `pinned`, `insecure`)
- `benchmark.ssl.cert.path` - Path to custom certificate file
- `benchmark.ssl.cert.pin` - SHA256 pin for certificate pinning

## Migration Plan

1. âœ… Document current state and security issues
2. ðŸ”„ Implement custom TrustManager with specific certificate trust
3. ðŸ”„ Add fallback to standard SSL validation
4. ðŸ”„ Update HttpClientFactory to use improved SSL configuration
5. ðŸ”„ Test with benchmark infrastructure
6. ðŸ”„ Update documentation with new approach

## Testing

The improved SSL configuration should be tested with:
1. Valid localhost certificate (should succeed)
2. Invalid/expired certificate (should fail)
3. No certificate file present (should fall back to standard validation)
4. Different hostname (should fail hostname verification)

This ensures both security and functionality are maintained.
