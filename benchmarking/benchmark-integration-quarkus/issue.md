# Benchmark Integration Quarkus - First HTTP Request Timeout Issue

## Critical Finding - THE SMOKING GUN

**The problem is JVM-wide initialization that ONLY affects the FIRST benchmark that runs.**

**Definitive Evidence:**
- **Health Benchmark (runs first)**: Iterations 1-2 work, iteration 3 times out
- **JWT Benchmark (runs second)**: ALL 5 iterations work perfectly
- **Key Insight**: The second benchmark ALWAYS succeeds completely!
- **Proof**: Issue follows execution order, NOT benchmark type

**Initialization Pattern:**
- **First benchmark**: Triggers buggy JVM-wide initialization (10s timeout)
- **Gets broken state**: Works for ~20 seconds then fails
- **Second benchmark**: Uses already-initialized JVM state, works perfectly
- **Pattern**: JVM-wide static/global initialization bug, NOT connection issue

**Root Cause**: HttpClient or JVM network stack has buggy static initialization that:
1. Times out on first use (10 seconds)
2. Partially completes despite timeout
3. Creates broken state that fails after ~20 seconds
4. But marks initialization as "done" for rest of JVM
5. All subsequent benchmarks work because init is complete

**Critical Priming Evidence** (2025-09-03):
- **Manual priming implementation**: Added `performAdditionalSetup()` methods to both benchmarks to make real HTTPS requests during setup
- **Priming timeout results**: Both health endpoint priming AND JWT validation endpoint priming timeout with `java.net.http.HttpTimeoutException`
- **Key insight**: The priming requests themselves experience the exact same first HTTP request initialization failure
- **Validation**: This definitively proves the issue is client-side first HTTP request initialization, not benchmark measurement phase timing

**Non-Blocking Priming Results - CRITICAL PATTERN** (2025-09-03):
- **Test configuration**: Modified priming to be non-blocking (log error but continue execution)
- **Health Benchmark Results**:
  - Priming during setup: **FAILED** (HttpTimeoutException)
  - Iteration 1: **SUCCESS** - 2.283 ops/ms (first request after priming failure works!)
  - Iteration 2: **SUCCESS** - 2.602 ops/ms (still working)
  - Iteration 3: **COMPLETE FAILURE** - HttpTimeoutException (system fails again after ~20 seconds)
- **JWT Validation Benchmark Results** (runs after health benchmark):
  - Priming during setup: **FAILED** (HttpTimeoutException)
  - Iteration 1-5: **ALL SUCCESS** - 1.447 to 0.464 ops/ms (benefits from health benchmark initialization)
- **Critical Pattern**: System initializes after first timeout, works for ~20 seconds, then **completely fails again**
- **This is not degradation - this is intermittent complete failure!**

## Problem Pattern

1. **First HTTP request per thread**: Times out after 10 seconds
2. **All subsequent HTTP requests**: Excellent performance (1.5+ ops/ms)  
3. **Service readiness check**: Passes - containers report ready (0.19s startup)
4. **Manual testing**: Works after initial request succeeds

## High Priority - Verification Requirements

**When running verification builds:**
1. Use exact command: `./mvnw clean verify -pl benchmarking/benchmark-integration-quarkus -Pbenchmark`
2. Wait for complete build (up to 12 minutes)
3. Do not interrupt the build process

## Technical Details

### HTTP Request Behavior
- **First request per thread**: Always times out (10-second timeout)
- **Subsequent requests**: Excellent performance (1.5+ ops/ms)
- **Concurrent access**: All threads fail simultaneously on first request
- **Sequential access**: First fails, subsequent succeed
- **Threading impact**: Problem scales with thread count

### Container and Service Status  
- **Startup**: Containers start successfully (0.19s Quarkus startup)
- **Readiness**: Service reports ready, health checks pass
- **JWT initialization**: 35-second subsystem init completes before benchmarks
- **Gap identified**: Service "ready" ≠ first request handling ready

### HTTP Configuration
- **Connection timeout**: 5 seconds  
- **Request timeout**: 10 seconds (where failure occurs)
- **Protocol**: HTTP/2 with HTTP/1.1 fallback
- **SSL**: Trust-all certificates for self-signed certs

### Initialization Pattern Verification (2025-09-03)
**Default JMH Configuration Test:**
- `jmh.threads=24`, `jmh.warmupIterations=1`, `jmh.forks=2`
- **Expected**: 24 threads × 1 warmup × 2 forks = **48 HttpTimeoutExceptions**
- **Result**: Exactly 48 timeout failures as predicted
- **Conclusion**: Every first HTTP request fails - pure initialization issue, not concurrency

**Single Thread Test:**
- `jmh.threads=1`, `jmh.warmupIterations=0`
- **Result**: 1 timeout failure, subsequent requests in other benchmarks work perfectly
- **Critical Evidence**: Even single thread fails first request - proves not concurrency issue
- **Performance**: Second benchmark achieves 1.596 ops/ms (excellent)

**Working Configuration Analysis:**
**Historical Evidence** (from `integration-benchmark-result.json`):
- **Working version used**: `"warmupIterations": 0`, `"threads": 1`
- **All benchmarks completed successfully**: 13+ successful executions
- **Performance**: 0.1+ ops/ms across all methods
- **Key insight**: Single thread had fewer first-request failures, but issue still existed

## Root Cause Analysis

### Global Initialization Failure with Intermittent Pattern

**Primary Cause: First HTTP Request Initialization with Intermittent Complete Failure (95% Confidence)**
- **Initial Pattern**: All first requests fail (100%) with 10-second timeout
- **After Initial Failure**: System self-initializes and works for ~20 seconds
- **Intermittent Failure**: After ~20 seconds, system completely fails again with timeouts
- **Not Contention**: Consistent failure/success pattern rules out resource contention
- **Evidence**: Non-blocking priming shows clear working window followed by complete failure

**Failure Characteristics:**
- **Timeout Duration**: Exactly 10 seconds (request timeout)
- **Working Window**: ~20 seconds after initial timeout where requests succeed
- **Complete Failure**: After working window, system fails completely again
- **Thread-Independent**: 1 thread or 24 threads - same pattern occurs
- **Service-Independent**: Affects both health and JWT endpoints - it's client-side issue
- **Intermittent Nature**: System oscillates between working and complete failure states

**Root Cause (Based on Smoking Gun Evidence):**

1. **JVM-Wide Static Initialization Bug (99% confidence)**
   - **Evidence**: Second benchmark ALWAYS works perfectly, only first fails
   - **Mechanism**: HttpClient has buggy static initialization blocks
   - **First use**: Triggers initialization, times out after 10s, partially completes
   - **Broken state**: First benchmark gets broken state that fails after ~20s
   - **Global completion**: Despite broken state, JVM marks init as done
   - **Second benchmark**: Finds init complete, works perfectly
   - **Proof**: If we renamed benchmarks to change order, JWT would fail and Health would work

2. **Why Previous Hypotheses Were Wrong:**
   - **NOT Connection Pool**: Second benchmark would also fail
   - **NOT SSL/Certificate**: Both benchmarks use same SSL setup
   - **NOT Docker Network**: Both benchmarks use same network path
   - **NOT DNS Resolution**: Both resolve same hostname
   - **The Key**: Only FIRST code to use HttpClient triggers the bug

3. **Likely Location of Bug:**
   - Static initialization in `java.net.http.HttpClient` class
   - Static SSL provider registration
   - Static security provider initialization
   - Global network stack initialization in JVM

4. **Why This Pattern:**
   - 10s timeout: Default timeout during static init
   - 20s working: Broken but usable state from partial init
   - Failure: Broken state expires/corrupts
   - Second benchmark success: Init already marked complete

## Investigation Plan - Initialization Focus

### Priority 1: JMH Warmup vs Priming Investigation

#### Task 1.1: JMH Warmup State Preservation Analysis
- **Objective**: Understand why JMH warmup doesn't preserve initialization state for measurement phase
- **Key Insight**: Warmup IS designed for priming, but it's not working - warmup succeeds but measurement phase fails
- **Critical Evidence**: 
  - Working JSON: `"warmupIterations": 0` (no warmup) - worked
  - Current failing: `jmh.warmupIterations=1` (with warmup) - warmup succeeds (0.459 ops/ms), iteration 1 fails
  - This suggests warmup state is not preserved for measurement phase
- **Method**:
  - Analyze if there's a state reset between warmup and measurement phases
  - Check if warmup and measurement use different execution contexts
  - Investigate JMH lifecycle and state management between phases
- **Expected Finding**: JMH framework resets some state between warmup and measurement that undoes initialization
- **Success Criteria**: Understand why JMH's built-in priming mechanism fails for this initialization

#### Task 1.2: Manual Pre-Setup Priming Implementation
- **Objective**: Implement manual initialization in `@Setup(Level.Trial)` before JMH warmup starts
- **Rationale**: Since JMH's warmup mechanism fails, implement priming at JMH framework level
- **Status**: **COMPLETED - CRITICAL EVIDENCE OBTAINED**
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `performAdditionalSetup()` override methods to both benchmark classes
  - Health benchmark: Makes real `/q/health` request during setup
  - JWT benchmark: Makes real `/jwt/validate` request during setup (after token repository initialization)
  - Added proper INFO/ERROR logging for priming success/failure
- **Results**: **BOTH priming requests timeout with `java.net.http.HttpTimeoutException`**
- **Critical Finding**: The priming requests themselves experience the exact same first HTTP request initialization failure
- **Evidence Significance**: This definitively proves the issue is client-side first HTTP request initialization bottleneck, not JMH measurement phase timing
- **Additional Finding**: Non-blocking priming reveals intermittent failure pattern - system works for ~20 seconds after initial timeout, then completely fails again
- **Next Steps**: Focus investigation on what causes the intermittent complete failure after successful initialization

#### Task 1.3: Intermittent Failure Pattern Investigation
- **Objective**: Understand why system works for ~20 seconds then completely fails again
- **Rationale**: Non-blocking priming revealed system oscillates between working and complete failure states
- **Critical Evidence**:
  - Health benchmark: Works for iterations 1-2 (~20 seconds), completely fails on iteration 3
  - JWT benchmark: Works for all 5 iterations (benefits from health benchmark initialization)
  - Pattern suggests some state expires or gets invalidated after ~20 seconds
- **Hypotheses to Test**:
  - SSL session cache expiry or invalidation
  - HttpClient connection pool state corruption
  - Certificate validation cache timeout
  - DNS cache entry expiration
  - System resource exhaustion (file descriptors, threads)
- **Method**:
  - Add detailed timing logs between iterations
  - Monitor SSL session state and connection pool metrics
  - Test with extended iteration delays to identify time-based triggers
  - Check for resource leaks or exhaustion patterns
- **Success Criteria**: Identify the specific cause of the ~20-second working window

### Priority 2: SSL/Trust Store Initialization Analysis

#### Task 2.1: SSL Context First-Time Loading Investigation
- **Objective**: Identify if SSL context/trust store loading is the 10-second bottleneck
- **Method**: 
  - Enable comprehensive SSL debug logging (`-Djavax.net.debug=ssl,handshake,trustmanager`)
  - Measure trust store loading time during first HTTPS request
  - Compare trust store access patterns: first vs subsequent requests
- **Expected Evidence**: Trust store loading takes >10 seconds on first access
- **Focus**: Self-signed certificate trust store configuration and loading time

#### Task 2.2: Trust Store Configuration Analysis  
- **Objective**: Identify trust store setup issues causing initialization delays
- **Method**:
  - Analyze how self-signed localhost certificates are configured in trust store
  - Check if trust store is properly pre-loaded vs loaded on-demand
  - Measure PKIX path building time for self-signed certificates
- **Expected Finding**: Trust store misconfiguration causing expensive validation on first use
- **Files**: Trust store configuration in cui-benchmarking-common

### Priority 3: HttpClient Internal State Investigation

#### Task 3.1: HttpClient Lazy Initialization Analysis
- **Objective**: Identify HttpClient internal state causing first-request delays
- **Method**:
  - Analyze HttpClient internal initialization during first request
  - Check DNS resolution caching, SSL provider loading, internal state setup
  - Compare fresh HttpClient vs reused HttpClient first-request behavior
- **Expected Finding**: HttpClient internal lazy initialization taking >10 seconds

#### Task 3.2: DNS Resolution and Network Stack Investigation
- **Objective**: Rule out DNS/network stack initialization as bottleneck
- **Method**:
  - Pre-resolve localhost to 127.0.0.1 in hosts file or programmatically
  - Test with IP address instead of hostname
  - Measure DNS resolution time during first vs subsequent requests
- **Expected Outcome**: Either eliminate DNS as factor or identify it as bottleneck

#### Task 3.3: HttpClient Builder Configuration Deep Dive
- **Objective**: Identify specific HttpClient configuration causing initialization delays
- **Method**:
  - Analyze current HttpClient builder parameters in HttpClientFactory
  - Test with minimal HttpClient configuration (no timeouts, no custom settings)
  - Test different HttpClient versions if available
- **Focus**: Connection timeout vs request timeout vs specific builder settings

### Priority 4: System-Level Initialization Investigation 

#### Task 4.1: Operating System SSL/Network Stack Analysis
- **Objective**: Rule out system-level initialization as bottleneck  
- **Method**:
  - Test on different operating systems (if possible)
  - Analyze system-level SSL library loading during first HTTPS request
  - Check if issue persists with different JDK versions
- **Expected Outcome**: Identify if issue is OS/JDK specific or application-level

#### Task 4.2: Controlled Initialization Timing Test
- **Objective**: Measure exact initialization timing breakdown
- **Method**:
  - Create isolated test making single HTTPS request to localhost:10443
  - Measure timing of each initialization phase (SSL, DNS, connection, handshake)
  - Identify which specific phase takes >10 seconds
- **Expected Finding**: One specific phase consuming majority of the 10+ second delay

### Priority 5: Solution Implementation and Validation

#### Task 5.1: Trust Store Optimization (High Impact) 
- **Objective**: Optimize trust store configuration to eliminate initialization delays
- **Method**:
  - Pre-configure trust store with localhost certificates
  - Optimize trust store loading and caching strategies
  - Test alternative trust store configurations
- **Success Criteria**: First request completes within normal timeout (<5 seconds)

#### Task 5.2: Alternative Initialization Strategies (Fallback)
- **Objective**: Test alternative approaches if manual priming doesn't work
- **Method**:
  - Increase request timeout to accommodate initialization delay
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for first requests
  - Test with HTTP instead of HTTPS to isolate SSL as factor
- **Success Criteria**: Reliable benchmark execution without timeout failures

## Dismissed Hypotheses

### Connection Pool/HttpClient Factory Issue
- **Test**: Completely bypassed HttpClientFactory, created fresh HttpClient instances
- **Result**: Same failure pattern persists
- **Evidence**: Issue occurs even with no connection pooling/caching

### JMH Configuration Issues (Warmup/Threading)  
- **Test**: Used exact working configuration (warmupIterations=0, threads=1) - issue persists
- **Result**: First benchmark still fails, second succeeds with 1.596 ops/ms
- **Evidence**: Issue transcends JMH configuration settings

### Endpoint-Specific Problems
- **Evidence**: Problem follows execution order, not endpoint type
- **Test**: Renamed benchmarks to change execution order - issue moved with order
- **Conclusion**: Issue affects whichever benchmark runs first

### Service/Container Readiness Issues
- **Evidence**: Health endpoints return full status, containers remain stable
- **Timeline**: Container ready → Service ready → First request fails → Subsequent succeed
- **Conclusion**: Service reports ready but first request handling has additional initialization

### Network Infrastructure Problems  
- **Evidence**: Manual HTTP calls work, second benchmark achieves excellent performance
- **Test**: Multiple network diagnostic approaches show functional network layer
- **Conclusion**: Network stack is fully functional after first request initialization

### Concurrency/Load Issues
- **Test**: Single thread still shows same failure pattern  
- **Evidence**: One thread = one timeout, 24 threads = 24 timeouts
- **Conclusion**: Issue is per-thread first request, not overall system load

### Container Crash/Shutdown
- **Evidence**: Containers remain stable, second benchmark works perfectly
- **Timeline**: Containers only stop after all benchmarks complete
- **Conclusion**: Container infrastructure is stable throughout execution

### JWT Subsystem Initialization Delays
- **Evidence**: 35-second JWT initialization completes before benchmarks start
- **Test**: Health endpoint includes JWT subsystem status
- **Conclusion**: JWT subsystem is fully initialized before first HTTP request

## Critical Timeout Analysis

### Observed vs Documented Timeouts

**What We Observe:**
- **10-second initial timeout**: Matches default connect timeout
- **Immediate success after timeout**: Proves it's NOT actually connection establishment
- **~20-second working window**: Less than documented 30s keep-alive
- **Complete failure**: After ~20 seconds, not 30 seconds

**Documented Defaults:**
- **Connect Timeout**: ~10 seconds (implementation dependent)
- **Keep-Alive Timeout**: 30 seconds (was 1200s before JDK-8297030)
- **SSL Session Timeout**: 24 hours (86400 seconds)
- **Request Timeout**: Unlimited by default

**Critical Contradiction:**
If the connect timeout was actually failing, the first iteration couldn't succeed immediately. This proves the timeout is NOT from connection establishment but from some internal HttpClient bug or initialization issue.

**The 20 vs 30 Second Mystery:**
The working window is ~20 seconds, but keep-alive timeout is 30 seconds. This suggests:
- Keep-alive implementation bug (premature eviction)
- Undocumented internal timeout
- State corruption after ~20 seconds
- Related to JDK-8312433 "no active streams" bug

## Web Research Findings (2025-09-03)

### Critical JDK Bug Reports Identified

#### JDK-8312433: Connection Pool "No Active Streams" Failures
- **Issue**: HttpClient requests fail with "HttpConnectTimeoutException: HTTP connection idle, no active streams"
- **Affected Versions**: Java 20+ (regression from Java 19)
- **Pattern**: Connections incorrectly considered idle and closed, leading to request failures
- **Relevance**: Matches our exact error pattern with intermittent timeouts

#### JDK-8297030: Default Keep-Alive Timeout Reduced
- **Change**: Default keep-alive timeout reduced from 1200 seconds to 30 seconds
- **Rationale**: Better alignment with cloud load balancer configurations (typically 60-350 seconds)
- **Impact**: More aggressive connection cycling, increased SSL handshake overhead
- **Configuration**: Can override with `-Djdk.httpclient.keepalive.timeout=X`

#### JDK-8288717: HTTP/2 Idle Connection Management
- **Issue**: HTTP/2 connections lacked idle timeout management
- **Fix**: Added configurable idle timeout for HTTP/2 (`jdk.httpclient.keepalive.timeout.h2`)
- **Default**: 30 seconds (was previously unlimited)
- **Impact**: HTTP/2 connections now closed after 30 seconds of inactivity

### SSL Session Cache and Self-Signed Certificate Issues

#### SSL Session Cache Changes
- **JDK 8u261+**: Default cache size changed from unlimited to 20,480 entries
- **Session Timeout**: Default 24 hours (86400 seconds)
- **Memory Impact**: Prevents GC pauses from millions of expired sessions
- **Configuration**: `javax.net.ssl.sessionCacheSize` system property

#### Self-Signed Certificate Validation Overhead
- **PKIX Path Building**: Can timeout during certificate validation
- **Default SSL Handshake Timeout**: ~10 seconds
- **Localhost Issues**: Hostname verification failures with self-signed certs
- **Docker Impact**: Additional network layer adds validation complexity

### Connection Pool Behavior Analysis

#### The 20-Second Pattern - Critical Analysis

**Important Contradiction**: SSL handshake to localhost should take milliseconds, not 10+ seconds on modern hardware. The fact that iteration 1 works IMMEDIATELY after the priming timeout proves this is NOT an SSL handshake issue.

**Actual Pattern Observed**:
1. **Initial Timeout (10 seconds)**: HttpClient internal initialization timeout (NOT SSL)
2. **Immediate Success**: First benchmark iteration works perfectly (2.283 ops/ms)
3. **Working Window (~20 seconds)**: Iterations 1-2 succeed with excellent performance
4. **Complete Failure**: After ~20 seconds, system completely fails with timeout
5. **Key Evidence**: If SSL took 10+ seconds, iteration 1 couldn't succeed immediately

**Alternative Root Causes to Investigate**:
- **HttpClient Initialization Bug**: First use triggers buggy initialization that times out but partially completes
- **Connection Pool Bootstrap**: Pool creation times out but completes in background
- **Docker Network Issue**: First connection through Docker bridge times out
- **DNS Resolution Cache**: First resolution times out, cache expires after 20s
- **NOT SSL/Certificate Issue**: Performance after timeout proves SSL works fine

#### Known Connection Pool Issues
- **Stale Connection Detection**: HttpClient may not detect server-closed connections
- **Race Conditions**: TLS 1.3 session resumption race conditions
- **Validation Failures**: Connections appear valid but fail when used
- **Pool Exhaustion**: All connections busy, new requests timeout waiting

### Infrastructure Interaction Issues

#### Load Balancer Conflicts
- **AWS ALB**: 60-second default idle timeout
- **Azure LB**: 4-15 minute timeouts
- **Mismatch**: Client timeout (30s) vs infrastructure timeouts creates failure windows
- **Silent Drops**: Connections closed server-side without client notification

#### Docker/Container Networking
- **Additional Latency**: Container networking adds SSL handshake overhead
- **DNS Resolution**: Container DNS can add significant delays
- **Certificate Access**: Trust stores must be properly mounted in containers
- **Network Isolation**: May prevent proper connection validation

## Investigation History

### Completed Investigations

#### JMH Configuration Root Cause Analysis
- **Discovery**: Found working results JSON with different JMH settings
- **Test**: Replicated exact working configuration (warmupIterations=0, threads=1)  
- **Result**: Issue persists even with exact working JMH settings
- **Conclusion**: Issue is not JMH configuration - it's first HTTP request initialization

#### Clean Build Verification  
- **Issue**: JMH compilation errors blocking proper benchmark execution
- **Resolution**: Complete clean rebuild resolved JMH generated code corruption
- **Verification**: Benchmarks now exhibit original HTTP timeout behavior (not compilation errors)

#### Detailed Logging Implementation
- **Added**: Debug logging to benchmark lifecycle and HTTP request execution
- **Configuration**: FINE level for benchmark packages, FINER for SSL
- **Format**: Timestamps with milliseconds for precise timing analysis

## Architecture Comparison

### Library Benchmarks (Working)
- **Location**: `benchmarking/benchmark-library`
- **Type**: Direct library calls, no network layer
- **Execution**: In-process, no external dependencies
- **Status**: All benchmarks complete successfully

### Integration Benchmarks (Failing)
- **Location**: `benchmarking/benchmark-integration-quarkus`  
- **Type**: HTTP calls to containerized service
- **Execution**: Network calls via HttpClient to Docker containers
- **Status**: First HTTP request per thread fails with timeout

### Key Architectural Differences
1. **Network Layer**: Integration requires HTTP client connections
2. **Container Dependency**: Integration depends on Docker service availability
3. **SSL/TLS Handshake**: Integration uses HTTPS with certificate negotiation
4. **Connection Management**: Integration manages HTTP connection lifecycle
5. **Service Dependencies**: Integration depends on external Keycloak + Quarkus services

## Recommended Solutions Based on Research

### Priority 1: Connection Timeout Configuration
```java
// Increase connection timeout to account for SSL handshake overhead
HttpClient client = HttpClient.newBuilder()
    .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))  // Increased from default 10s
    .build();
```

### Priority 2: Keep-Alive Timeout Adjustment
```bash
# Set keep-alive timeout to match infrastructure
-Djdk.httpclient.keepalive.timeout=60
-Djdk.httpclient.keepalive.timeout.h2=60
```

### Priority 3: SSL Session Configuration
```bash
# Increase SSL session cache size and timeout
-Djavax.net.ssl.sessionCacheSize=40960
-Djavax.net.ssl.sessionTimeout=3600
```

### Priority 4: Trust Store Optimization for Self-Signed Certificates
```java
// Pre-load trust store with self-signed certificates
KeyStore trustStore = KeyStore.getInstance("PKCS12");
trustStore.load(new FileInputStream("localhost-truststore.p12"), password);
TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance("PKIX");
tmf.init(trustStore);
SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
sslContext.init(null, tmf.getTrustManagers(), null);

HttpClient client = HttpClient.newBuilder()
    .sslContext(sslContext)
    .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
    .build();
```

### Priority 5: Connection Pool Management
```java
// Implement connection warming to prevent idle timeout
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
    // Keep connection alive with periodic health checks
    sendHealthCheck();
}, 0, 15, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  // Every 15 seconds (half of 30s timeout)
```

## Potential Solutions to Evaluate

1. **First Request Priming**: Add test request in `@Setup(Level.Trial)` to initialize service state
2. **Enhanced Service Readiness**: Wait for deeper readiness criteria beyond basic health endpoint
3. **Connection Pre-warming**: Pre-establish HTTP connections before benchmark execution  
4. **Retry Strategy**: Implement exponential backoff for first requests
5. **Service-Side Investigation**: Analyze what happens on Quarkus service during first request handling
