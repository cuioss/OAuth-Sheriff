== Optimization Strategies

=== Container and Native Image Optimization

**Native Compilation Tuning**:
```xml
<quarkus.native.additional-build-args>
  -O2,
  --enable-all-security-services,
  --initialize-at-build-time=sun.security.provider.SecureRandom
</quarkus.native.additional-build-args>
```

**Benefits Achieved**:
* Memory footprint: ~6MB (vs 100MB+ JVM)
* Startup time: <100ms (vs several seconds JVM)
* Predictable performance (no JIT warmup)

**Container Resource Tuning**:
* CPU allocation: 2-4 cores optimal for M4
* Memory limits: 128MB sufficient 
* Network optimization: connection pooling essential

=== HTTP and Networking Optimization

**Connection Pool Configuration**:
```java
HttpClient.newBuilder()
    .executor(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(50))
    .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
    .build();
```

**Impact**:
* Reduced connection establishment overhead
* Better thread utilization under load
* Lower P99 latencies for HTTP processing

=== JWT-Specific Optimizations

**Caching Strategy**:
* Access token caching with configurable eviction
* JWKS key caching to avoid repeated fetches
* Balanced cache size vs memory usage

**Validation Pipeline**:
* Parallel validation of token components where possible
* Early validation failures to avoid expensive operations
* Efficient error handling paths
