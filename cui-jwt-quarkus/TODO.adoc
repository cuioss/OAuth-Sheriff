This document outlines the planned tasks for the cui-jwt-quarkus module.

== Task Structure

=== Task Numbering

Tasks are numbered sequentially (e.g., Task 1, Task 2, Task 3) for easy reference and tracking.

=== Task Format

Each task follows a consistent format:

[source]
----
=== Task [Number]. [Task Title]
[ ] *Priority:* [High/Medium/Low]

*Description:* [Detailed description of the task]

*Rationale:* [Explanation of why this task is important]
----

== Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked using checkboxes in the task list:

* `[ ]` - Task not started or in progress
* `[x]` - Task completed

This simple visual indicator allows for quick assessment of project status. The checkboxes are updated manually after completing a task according to the Task Completion Process.

=== Current Progress

Progress can be assessed by:

. Counting completed tasks within each category
. Calculating the overall completion percentage
. Focusing on high-priority tasks first

== Task Completion Process

After implementing any task in this TODO list, follow these steps:

. *Verify Documentation*: Ensure the documentation is updated correctly. Especially verify all the links/names are correct and consistent with the refactoring changes made.
* [ ] Update all references in README.adoc
* [ ] Update relevant documentation in doc/ directory
* [ ] Check for outdated file paths or references
* [ ] Ensure consistent naming across all documentation

. *Update Status*: Check the checkbox for the completed task in this TODO.adoc file.
* [ ] Mark the task as completed with [x]
* [ ] Add any notes about implementation challenges or decisions if needed

. *Make a Full Build*: Run `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify -pl cui-jwt-quarkus` (from project-root)to ensure all tests pass.
* [ ] Run the full build command
* [ ] Verify all tests pass
* [ ] Check for any warnings that should be addressed

. *Commit Changes (git-commit)*: Commit the changes with a git commit. Use the task name (e.g., "Task 1. Implement JWT Configuration") as the commit message.
* [ ] Stage all modified files
* [ ] Use the task name as the commit message
* [ ] Include any additional notes about implementation decisions in the commit description

== Quarkus Integration Tasks

=== Task 1. Setup Quarkus Configuration Properties
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Implement Quarkus configuration properties for JWT validation, including:

. Create a configuration class using `@ConfigMapping` or `@ConfigProperties` annotation
. Define properties for:
   * JWT issuer URLs/endpoints
   * Public key locations
   * JWT claim validations (audience, expiration tolerance, etc.)
   * JWKS endpoint configuration (cache TTL, refresh interval)
   * Keystore configuration options
   * The configuration must support the multi-issuer aproach of the library. Saying each of the configuration above mus be able to be configured for each issuer.
   * The key are to be prexifed with `cui.jwt`
. Implement property validation using Bean Validation annotations
. Provide sensible default values
. Add configuration documentation

*Rationale:* Proper configuration is essential for the JWT validation module to work effectively in a Quarkus application. Using Quarkus' configuration system allows for type-safe configuration with runtime validation and makes it easier for users to understand available options.

*Implementation Steps:*

* [ ] Create JwtValidationConfig class with appropriate annotations
* [ ] Define and document all configuration properties
* [ ] Implement validation logic for configuration values
* [ ] Create unit tests for configuration parsing and validation
* [ ] Document all configuration options in README

=== Task 2. Implement CDI Producers
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Create CDI producers for the core JWT validation components:

. Create a producer class that provides:
   * `TokenValidator` bean
. Ensure proper injection of configuration properties
. Implement appropriate qualifiers if multiple configurations/instances are needed
. Configure beans as application-scoped where appropriate
. Add startup validation to fail fast if configuration is invalid

*Rationale:* CDI producers allow Quarkus applications to easily inject and use the JWT validation components without manual instantiation. This improves developer experience and ensures proper configuration and lifecycle management of the components.

*Implementation Steps:*

* [ ] Create TokenValidatorProducer class
* [ ] Implement producer methods for core components
* [ ] Add appropriate scopes and qualifiers
* [ ] Create unit tests for producers
* [ ] Document available beans in README

=== Task 3. Integrate SecurityEvents with Micrometer
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Implement metrics reporting for JWT validation events:

. Create a security event listener that subscribes to events from the validation module
. Map security events to appropriate Micrometer metrics:
   * Counter for validation attempts (success/failure)
   * Counter for specific validation error types
   * Timer for validation duration
   * Gauge for JWKS cache size
. Add tags/labels to metrics for better filtering (issuer, validation type, etc.)
. Ensure metrics follow Micrometer best practices
. Provide documentation on available metrics

*Rationale:* Integration with Micrometer allows applications to monitor JWT validation performance and issues in production. This is essential for detecting potential security problems, performance bottlenecks, or configuration issues.

*Implementation Steps:*

* [ ] Create SecurityEventMetricsCollector class
* [ ] Define appropriate metrics with meaningful names
* [ ] Implement event listener methods for different event types
* [ ] Add unit tests for metrics collection
* [ ] Document all exposed metrics

=== Task 4. Implement Health Checks
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Create Quarkus health checks for JWT validation components:

. Implement a health check for JWKS endpoint connectivity
. Add a health check for token validation capabilities
. Include relevant details in health check responses
. Configure appropriate health check groups
. Ensure health checks don't impact performance

*Rationale:* Health checks provide visibility into the operational status of JWT validation components, which is crucial for containerized environments and Kubernetes deployments.

*Implementation Steps:*

* [ ] Create JwtValidationHealthCheck class
* [ ] Implement health check logic
* [ ] Configure appropriate scopes and groups
* [ ] Add unit tests for health checks
* [ ] Document health check endpoints and responses

=== Task 5. Create Extension Documentation
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Create comprehensive documentation for the Quarkus extension:

. Write a user guide covering:
   * Installation instructions
   * Configuration options with examples
   * Usage patterns and best practices
   * Available metrics and their interpretation
   * Troubleshooting guide
. Create Javadoc for all public APIs
. Include example projects demonstrating common use cases

*Rationale:* Good documentation is essential for adoption and proper use of the extension. Clear examples and explanations will help users avoid common pitfalls and security issues.

*Implementation Steps:*

* [ ] Create user guide document
* [ ] Document all configuration options
* [ ] Add code examples for common scenarios
* [ ] Write troubleshooting section
* [ ] Review and finalize documentation

== Best Practices

=== Task Implementation

* Focus on one task at a time
* Complete the entire Task Completion Process before moving to the next task
* Prioritize tasks based on their priority level (High, Medium, Low)
* Document any unexpected challenges or decisions made during implementation

=== Documentation Updates

* Keep this TODO.adoc file up to date
* Document any changes to the implementation process
* Ensure all team members understand the process

== Conclusion

This structured approach ensures that the Quarkus integration is implemented systematically, with clear tracking of progress and consistent quality standards. The task list provides a roadmap for developing a robust, well-documented Quarkus extension for JWT validation.
