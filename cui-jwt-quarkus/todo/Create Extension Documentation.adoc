== Overview
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Create comprehensive documentation for the Quarkus extension:

. Write a user guide covering:
   * Installation instructions with Maven/Gradle dependency examples
   * Configuration options with YAML and properties examples for each scenario:
     - Single issuer configuration
     - Multiple issuer configuration
     - Custom claim mapping
     - Advanced security settings
   * Usage patterns and best practices:
     - Injecting and using TokenValidator
     - Handling validation errors
     - Integration with Quarkus security
     - Performance optimization tips
   * Available metrics and their interpretation with Prometheus query examples
   * Health check endpoints and response interpretation
   * Troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions
. Create Javadoc for all public APIs following CUI standards
. Include example projects demonstrating common use cases:
   * Basic JWT validation
   * Multi-issuer setup
   * Custom claim mapping
   * Integration with Quarkus security

*Rationale:* Good documentation is essential for adoption and proper use of the extension. Clear examples and explanations will help users avoid common pitfalls and security issues.

== Implementation Steps

* [ ] Create user guide document in AsciiDoc format
* [ ] Document all configuration options with type information and validation constraints
* [ ] Add code examples for common scenarios with full context
* [ ] Create configuration examples in both YAML and properties format
* [ ] Write troubleshooting section with common errors and solutions
* [ ] Create example projects in a separate directory
* [ ] Ensure all public APIs have proper Javadoc
* [ ] Add security considerations section
* [ ] Review and finalize documentation

== Task Completion Checklist

*1. Verify Implementation:*
* [ ] Verify all implementation steps are completed
* [ ] Check code against Quarkus and CUI standards
* [ ] Ensure proper error handling and edge cases are covered
* [ ] Verify compatibility with both JVM and native mode

*2. Write Tests:*
* [ ] Write unit tests for all components
* [ ] Create integration tests for real-world scenarios
* [ ] Test with different configuration options
* [ ] Verify error cases and edge conditions

*3. Verify Documentation:*
* [ ] Update all references in README.adoc
* [ ] Update relevant documentation in doc/ directory
* [ ] Check for outdated file paths or references
* [ ] Ensure consistent naming across all documentation
* [ ] Add examples for common use cases

*4. Update Status:*
* [ ] Mark the task as completed with [x]
* [ ] Add any notes about implementation challenges or decisions if needed

*5. Make a Full Build:*
* [ ] Run the full build command: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify -pl cui-jwt-quarkus` (from project-root)
* [ ] Verify all tests pass
* [ ] Check for any warnings that should be addressed
* [ ] Verify code coverage meets standards

*6. Commit Changes:*
* [ ] Stage all modified files
* [ ] Use the task name as the commit message
* [ ] Include any additional notes about implementation decisions in the commit description
