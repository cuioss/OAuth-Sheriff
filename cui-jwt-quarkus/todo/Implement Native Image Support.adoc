== Overview
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Ensure the extension works properly in native mode:

. Add native image configuration:
   * Create reflection configuration for classes that need reflection
   * Configure resources that need to be included in the native image
   * Add proxy configuration for dynamic proxies
. Test native image compatibility:
   * Create native tests with @NativeImageTest
   * Verify all functionality works in native mode
   * Measure and optimize native startup time
. Optimize for native performance:
   * Minimize reflection usage where possible
   * Use build-time initialization where appropriate
   * Ensure proper resource cleanup

*Rationale:* Native image support is a key feature of Quarkus, and extensions should work seamlessly in both JVM and native modes. This requires special configuration and testing to ensure all functionality works correctly when compiled to a native executable.

== Implementation Steps

* [ ] Create native image configuration files
* [ ] Add reflection configuration for necessary classes
* [ ] Configure resource inclusion
* [ ] Add proxy configuration if needed
* [ ] Create native tests
* [ ] Optimize for native performance
* [ ] Document native image considerations

== Task Completion Checklist

*1. Verify Implementation:*
* [ ] Verify all implementation steps are completed
* [ ] Check code against Quarkus and CUI standards
* [ ] Ensure proper error handling and edge cases are covered
* [ ] Verify compatibility with both JVM and native mode

*2. Write Tests:*
* [ ] Write unit tests for all components
* [ ] Create integration tests for real-world scenarios
* [ ] Test with different configuration options
* [ ] Verify error cases and edge conditions

*3. Verify Documentation:*
* [ ] Update all references in README.adoc
* [ ] Update relevant documentation in doc/ directory
* [ ] Check for outdated file paths or references
* [ ] Ensure consistent naming across all documentation
* [ ] Add examples for common use cases

*4. Update Status:*
* [ ] Mark the task as completed with [x]
* [ ] Add any notes about implementation challenges or decisions if needed

*5. Make a Full Build:*
* [ ] Run the full build command: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify -pl cui-jwt-quarkus` (from project-root)
* [ ] Verify all tests pass
* [ ] Check for any warnings that should be addressed
* [ ] Verify code coverage meets standards

*6. Commit Changes:*
* [ ] Stage all modified files
* [ ] Use the task name as the commit message
* [ ] Include any additional notes about implementation decisions in the commit description
