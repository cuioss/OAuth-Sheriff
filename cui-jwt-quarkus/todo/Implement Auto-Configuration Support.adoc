== Overview
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Implement auto-configuration support for the Quarkus extension:

. Create runtime configuration classes:
   * Implement build-time configuration with `@BuildTimeConfig`
   * Implement runtime configuration with `@ConfigRoot`
   * Add proper default values and validation
. Add feature detection and conditional enablement:
   * Create feature detection logic to enable/disable components based on classpath
   * Implement conditional bean registration
. Implement proper bean lifecycle management:
   * Handle startup and shutdown properly
   * Ensure proper cleanup of resources
. Add extension capability metadata:
   * Define extension capabilities and requirements
   * Configure proper extension dependencies

*Rationale:* Proper auto-configuration is essential for a seamless user experience with Quarkus extensions. It allows the extension to work out-of-the-box with minimal configuration while still providing flexibility for advanced use cases.

== Implementation Steps

* [ ] Create runtime configuration classes with proper annotations
* [ ] Implement feature detection logic
* [ ] Add conditional bean registration
* [ ] Configure proper bean lifecycle management
* [ ] Define extension capabilities and requirements
* [ ] Test auto-configuration with different scenarios
* [ ] Document auto-configuration behavior

== Task Completion Checklist

*1. Verify Implementation:*
* [ ] Verify all implementation steps are completed
* [ ] Check code against Quarkus and CUI standards
* [ ] Ensure proper error handling and edge cases are covered
* [ ] Verify compatibility with both JVM and native mode

*2. Write Tests:*
* [ ] Write unit tests for all components
* [ ] Create integration tests for real-world scenarios
* [ ] Test with different configuration options
* [ ] Verify error cases and edge conditions

*3. Verify Documentation:*
* [ ] Update all references in README.adoc
* [ ] Update relevant documentation in doc/ directory
* [ ] Check for outdated file paths or references
* [ ] Ensure consistent naming across all documentation
* [ ] Add examples for common use cases

*4. Update Status:*
* [ ] Mark the task as completed with [x]
* [ ] Add any notes about implementation challenges or decisions if needed

*5. Make a Full Build:*
* [ ] Run the full build command: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify -pl cui-jwt-quarkus` (from project-root)
* [ ] Verify all tests pass
* [ ] Check for any warnings that should be addressed
* [ ] Verify code coverage meets standards

*6. Commit Changes:*
* [ ] Stage all modified files
* [ ] Use the task name as the commit message
* [ ] Include any additional notes about implementation decisions in the commit description
