[IMPORTANT]
====
This document follows the refactoring process standards defined in `/Users/oliver/git/cui-llm-rules/standards/process/refactoring-process.adoc`.
====

== Purpose

This document tracks the resolution of code smells identified by SonarCloud analysis for the cui-jwt project to achieve 100% clean code status.

== Task Structure

=== Categories and Numbering

Tasks are organized into categories with the following prefixes:

* *C* - Code Structure and Design tasks
* *T* - Testing Improvements tasks

=== Task Format

Each task follows the standard format as defined in the refactoring process documentation.

== Issues to Address

=== Code Structure and Design

==== C1. Refactor VertxHttpServletRequestAdapter Method (Line 478)
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Refactor the method at line 478 in `VertxHttpServletRequestAdapter.java` to reduce cognitive complexity from 24 to the allowed maximum of 15.

*Rationale:* High cognitive complexity makes code harder to understand, test, and maintain. This is a critical issue that impacts code maintainability.

==== C2. Refactor VertxHttpServletRequestAdapter Method (Line 612)
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Refactor the method at line 612 in `VertxHttpServletRequestAdapter.java` to reduce cognitive complexity from 19 to the allowed maximum of 15.

*Rationale:* Methods with high cognitive complexity are prone to bugs and difficult to maintain. Reducing complexity improves code quality and testability.

==== C3. Break Cyclic Dependency in Producer Package
[ ] *Priority:* High

*Description:* Resolve the cyclic dependency between 2 classes within the `de.cuioss.jwt.quarkus.producer` package, specifically involving `BearerTokenResult.java:74`.

*Rationale:* Cyclic dependencies violate clean architecture principles, make the code harder to understand, and can lead to initialization issues.

==== C4. Refactor IssuerConfig Constructor
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Refactor the constructor in `IssuerConfig.java:791` that has 8 parameters to have 7 or fewer parameters.

*Rationale:* Too many constructor parameters indicate poor design, make the code harder to use correctly, and increase the risk of parameter confusion.

=== Testing Improvements

==== T1. Parameterize KeycloakDefaultGroupsMapperTest Tests
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Replace 4 similar tests in `KeycloakDefaultGroupsMapperTest.java:138` with a single parameterized test.

*Rationale:* Parameterized tests reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and make it easier to add new test cases.

==== T2. Remove Duplicate Test Implementation in MandatoryClaimsValidatorTest
[ ] *Priority:* Medium

*Description:* Update the test method at line 249 so that its implementation is not identical to `shouldFailValidationWhenSubjectClaimIsMissing` on line 88.

*Rationale:* Duplicate test implementations provide no additional value and increase maintenance burden.

== Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked using checkboxes in the task list:

* `[ ]` - Task not started or in progress
* `[x]` - Task completed

=== Current Progress

* Code Structure and Design: 0/4 completed
* Testing Improvements: 0/2 completed
* Overall: 0/6 completed

== Task Completion Process

After implementing any refactoring task, follow the standardized process defined in the Task Completion Standards:

1. Implement the fix following SonarCloud recommendations
2. Run quality verification: `./mvnw -Ppre-commit clean verify -pl [module]`
3. Run full build: `./mvnw clean install -pl [module]`
4. Create pull request with task ID in title
5. Wait for SonarCloud analysis in CI/CD
6. Mark task as complete `[x]` once merged

When committing refactoring changes, use the task identifier and title as the commit subject (e.g., "refactor: C1. Refactor VertxHttpServletRequestAdapter Method").

== Adding New Tasks

When adding new tasks from SonarCloud analysis:

1. Identify the appropriate category (C for code, T for testing)
2. Use the next available number within that category
3. Follow the standard task format
4. Include priority, description, and rationale
5. Start with an unchecked checkbox `[ ]`

== Best Practices

=== Task Implementation

* Focus on one task at a time
* Complete the entire Task Completion Process before moving to the next task
* Prioritize tasks based on their priority level (High, Medium, Low)
* Document any unexpected challenges or decisions made during implementation

=== Documentation Updates

* Keep this file up to date with task completion status
* Document any changes to the refactoring approach
* Ensure all team members understand the process

== Conclusion

This structured approach ensures that SonarCloud issues are resolved systematically, with clear tracking of progress and consistent quality standards. The categorization and numbering system provides flexibility while maintaining organization.
