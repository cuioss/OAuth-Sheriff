# JWT Performance Optimization - Actionable TODOs

## üî• IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (This Week)

### 1. Deep JFR Callstack Analysis
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must identify specific JWT validation bottlenecks

- [ ] **1.1** Run JFR profiling during JWT validation benchmark
  ```bash
  cd cui-jwt-quarkus-parent/cui-jwt-quarkus-integration-tests
  ./scripts/benchmark-with-monitoring.sh
  # Analyze generated JFR files in monitoring-results/
  ```

- [ ] **1.2** Profile tokenValidator.createAccessToken() method specifically
  - Use JFR method profiling to identify hotspots within JWT validation
  - Focus on: JSON parsing, signature validation, claims processing
  - Target: Find methods consuming 80%+ of JWT validation time

- [ ] **1.3** Compare JFR profiles: JWT vs NOOP endpoints
  - Side-by-side analysis to isolate JWT-specific CPU consumption
  - Quantify exact time spent in each JWT validation phase
  - Document findings in performance-optimization-log.adoc

### 2. TokenValidator Integration Analysis
**Priority**: HIGH - Understand 100x performance gap (30k library vs 260 integration)

- [ ] **2.1** Research cui-jwt-validation library's own benchmarks
  - Find library's JMH benchmark results (reported ~30k ops/s)
  - Compare library benchmark methodology vs current integration
  - Identify what's different between standalone and Quarkus integration

- [ ] **2.2** Profile Quarkus-specific overhead
  - Analyze CDI injection, proxy overhead, transaction boundaries
  - Identify Quarkus processing layers affecting JWT validation
  - Measure per-request configuration loading overhead

## üìä WEEK 1 DELIVERABLES

1. **JFR Analysis Report**: Detailed breakdown of JWT validation time consumption
2. **Integration Overhead Analysis**: Quantified Quarkus integration tax
3. **Optimization Priority List**: Ranked by time consumption and feasibility
4. **Updated Performance Log**: All findings documented with concrete numbers

## üéØ WEEK 2 TARGETS

Based on Week 1 findings, implement top 3 highest-impact optimizations:

### Potential High-Impact Areas (Pending Analysis)
- [ ] **JSON Parsing Optimization**: If Jackson ObjectMapper is major bottleneck
- [ ] **Signature Validation Optimization**: If RSA verification dominates time
- [ ] **CDI/Integration Optimization**: If Quarkus overhead is significant
- [ ] **Object Allocation Reduction**: If GC pressure is substantial

### Success Criteria
- **Target**: 5-10x performance improvement (1,300-2,600 ops/s)
- **Verification**: Each optimization tested individually with >5% threshold
- **Documentation**: All attempts recorded with concrete before/after metrics

## üîß TOOLS AND SCRIPTS

### Benchmark Execution
```bash
# Standard benchmark with comprehensive monitoring
./scripts/benchmark-with-monitoring.sh

# JFR analysis (already integrated in above script)
# Results in: monitoring-results/jwt-validation-TIMESTAMP.jfr
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
# Extract JFR hotspots
jfr print --events CPUSample monitoring-results/jwt-validation-*.jfr

# Compare different endpoints
jfr print --events MethodProfiling monitoring-results/jwt-validation-*.jfr | grep -E "(createAccessToken|validateToken)"
```

## üìã SUCCESS METRICS

**Week 1 Goal**: Understand bottlenecks
- [ ] Identify methods consuming 80%+ of JWT validation time
- [ ] Quantify Quarkus integration overhead
- [ ] Create prioritized optimization list

**Week 2 Goal**: Implement optimizations
- [ ] Achieve 5-10x performance improvement (1,300-2,600 ops/s)
- [ ] Maintain 100%+ CPU utilization
- [ ] Document all optimization attempts

**Ultimate Target**: 10-50x improvement (2,600-13,000 ops/s)
- Based on library capability of 30k ops/s
- Focus on eliminating integration inefficiencies
- Postpone caching due to security implications

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **No Caching Yet**: Security implications require code optimization first
2. **Single Changes**: Test each optimization individually
3. **JFR Always**: Profile every change to understand impact
4. **Document Everything**: Update performance-optimization-log.adoc immediately
5. **Framework is Fast**: Don't optimize REST/HTTP (280k ops/s baseline)
